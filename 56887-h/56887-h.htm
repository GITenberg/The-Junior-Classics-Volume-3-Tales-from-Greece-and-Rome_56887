<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Homer, that king of story-tellers, traveller and
well-loved school teacher, is supposed to have lived
in Greece about three thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Trained story-tellers or bards, with extraordinary
memories, were not rare in that simple age.
Many argue that writing for literary purposes was
not used by the Greeks at that time, and that
Homer recited his tales to groups of friends, to his
school children, and at the great yearly festivals.
It is amazing what memories people had in the days
when there were no books, when there were not a
thousand and one things to distract them; yet we
have proof that such memories are possible in our
time. About fifty years ago, poor, uneducated
Blind Jamie was a well-known character in the
town of Stirling, in Scotland. He could recite the
Bible from beginning to end, without mistake, and
could even repeat any verse from any part of the
Bible.</p>

<p>From the mass of old folk tales that he gathered
on his travels, Homer, the inspired minstrel, wove
one continuous story, the greatest epic poems of all
time, The Iliad and The Odyssey. Later, one of
the Greek chroniclers tells us, Pisistratus edited
them with taste and care, “in the order in which we
have them.”</p>

<p>Although the world we visit in Homer’s pages is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a Greek world, it is singularly like our own in many
respects. His men and women face the same
problems of war and peace, of triumph and defeat,
of pleasure and pain, as we do. His soldiers and
sailors in the spirit-stirring war might be men of
to-day. And best of all, he makes us see, feel, hope,
fear, laugh and cry through these marvellous pages,
over which, for hundreds of years, boys and girls of
all countries have lingered, entranced.</p>

<p>The Iliad is the account of the Trojan War.
The Odyssey tells of the Grecian hero, Ulysses, and
of his years of wandering and adventure, after the
fall of Troy, before he finally reaches his home and
wife and son, in Ithaca.</p>

<p>Later, Virgil, greatest of Roman poets, in his
desire to do for the Latin nation what Homer did
for the Greeks, wrote the Æneid. In this he describes
the adventures of the Trojan hero, Æneas.
As you will see, his book is modelled after Homer’s,
even in small details.</p>

<p>Homer and Sir Thomas Malory may be said to
have each performed for his native country a somewhat
similar task, each, of course, in his own way.
Each retold the current folk tales in such a superior
manner that his became the accepted version, to the
practical exclusion of all others, and it is thus in a
very real sense that we are indebted to Homer for
Ulysses and to Malory for King Arthur.</p>

<p>The old Greek tales at the beginning of the book
are from Ovid (43 <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>), Apollodorus (140 <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>)
and Pindar (522 <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span>), and they have been retold
in delightful fashion by Nathaniel Hawthorne,
Charles Kingsley and Miss Buckley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>As the stories from Homer and Virgil, in the
versions here given, can only be looked upon as introductory
to more extended reading, and are, consequently,
something with which scholarship can
have little if any quarrel, it has seemed desirable
to make them as simple and clear as possible. For
this reason the Latin names for the gods and goddesses
of the Greek mythology have been used
throughout. These names have been handed down
to us in the works of Shakespeare, Milton, Keats,
and many others, and usage has made them familiar.
Jupiter, Juno, Mars, Diana and Neptune, are old
friends whose attributes are recognized at once,
while to many the Grecian Zeus, Hera, Ares, Artemis
and Poseidon are strangers whose names might
have to be looked up in the classical dictionary.
With the exception of a word here and there, there
has been no editing of the stories, but occasional
passages that delayed the movement of a story have
been omitted.</p>

<h3 id="HOW_THESEUS_SLAYS_THE">HOW THESEUS SLAYS THE
MINOTAUR</h3>

<p class="author">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the old city of Trœzene, at the foot of a lofty
mountain, there lived, a very long time ago, a
little boy named Theseus. His grandfather, King
Pittheus, was the sovereign of that country, and
was reckoned a very wise man; so that Theseus, being
brought up in the royal palace, and being naturally
a bright lad, could hardly fail of profiting by
the old king’s instructions. His mother’s name was
Æthra. As for his father, the boy had never seen
him. But, from his earliest remembrance, Æthra
used to go with little Theseus into a wood, and sit
down upon a moss-grown rock, which was deeply
sunken into the earth. Here she often talked with
her son about his father, and said that he was called
Ægeus, and that he was a great king, and ruled
over Attica, and dwelt at Athens, which was as
famous a city as any in the world. Theseus was
very fond of hearing about King Ægeus, and often
asked his good mother Æthra why he did not come
and live with them at Trœzene.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear son,” answered Æthra, with a sigh,
“a monarch has his people to take care of. The men
and women over whom he rules are in the place of
children to him; and he can seldom spare time to
love his own children as other parents do. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
father will never be able to leave his kingdom for
the sake of seeing his little boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, but, dear mother,” asked the boy, “why
cannot I go to this famous city of Athens, and tell
King Ægeus that I am his son?”</p>

<p>“That may happen by-and-by,” said Æthra. “Be
patient, and we shall see. You are not yet big and
strong enough to set out on such an errand.”</p>

<p>“And how soon shall I be strong enough?”
Theseus persisted in inquiring.</p>

<p>“You are but a tiny boy as yet,” replied his
mother. “See if you can lift this rock on which we
are sitting.”</p>

<p>The little fellow had a great opinion of his own
strength. So, grasping the rough protuberances of
the rock, he tugged and toiled amain, and got himself
quite out of breath, without being able to stir
the heavy stone. It seemed to be rooted into the
ground. No wonder he could not move it; for it
would have taken all the force of a very strong
man to lift it out of its earthy bed.</p>

<p>His mother stood looking on, with a sad kind of
a smile on her lips and in her eyes, to see the zealous
and yet puny efforts of her little boy. She could
not help being sorrowful at finding him already so
impatient to begin his adventures in the world.</p>

<p>“You see how it is, my dear Theseus,” said she,
“you must possess far more strength than now before
I can trust you to go to Athens, and tell King
Ægeus that you are his son. But when you can lift
this rock, and show me what is hidden beneath it,
I promise you my permission to depart.”</p>

<p>Often and often, after this, did Theseus ask his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
mother, whether it was yet time for him to go to
Athens; and still his mother pointed to the rock, and
told him that, for years to come, he could not be
strong enough to move it. And again and again the
rosy-cheeked and curly-headed boy would tug and
strain at the huge mass of stone, striving, child as he
was, to do what a giant could hardly have done
without taking both of his great hands to the task.
Meanwhile the rock seemed to be sinking farther
and farther into the ground. The moss grew over it
thicker and thicker, until at last it looked almost
like a soft green seat, with only a few gray knobs
of granite peeping out. The overhanging trees,
also, shed their brown leaves upon it, as often
as the autumn came; and at its base grew ferns
and wild flowers, some of which crept quite over
its surface. To all appearance, the rock was as
firmly fastened as any other portion of the earth’s
substance.</p>

<p>But, difficult as the matter looked, Theseus was
now growing up to be such a vigorous youth, that,
in his own opinion, the time would quickly come
when he might hope to get the upper hand of this
ponderous lump of stone.</p>

<p>“Mother, I do believe it has started!” cried he,
after one of his attempts. “The earth around it is
certainly a little cracked!”</p>

<p>“No, no, child!” his mother hastily answered.
“It is not possible you can have moved it, such a
boy as you still are.”</p>

<p>Nor would she be convinced, although Theseus
showed her the place where he fancied that the stem
of a flower had been partly uprooted by the movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the rock. But Æthra sighed and looked
disquieted; for, no doubt, she began to be conscious
that her son was no longer a child, and that, in a
little while hence, she must send him forth among
the perils and troubles of the world.</p>

<p>It was not more than a year afterwards when
they were again sitting on the moss-covered stone.
Æthra had once more told him the oft-repeated
story of his father, and how gladly he would receive
Theseus at his stately palace, and how he
would present him to his courtiers and the people,
and tell them that here was the heir of his dominions.
The eyes of Theseus glowed with enthusiasm,
and he would hardly sit still to hear his mother
speak.</p>

<p>“Dear mother Æthra,” he exclaimed, “I never
felt half so strong as now! I am no longer a child,
nor a boy, nor a mere youth! I feel myself a man!
It is now time to make one earnest trial to remove
the stone.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dearest Theseus,” replied his mother,
“not yet! not yet!”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” said he, resolutely, “the time has
come!”</p>

<p>Then Theseus bent himself in good earnest to
the task, and strained every sinew, with manly
strength and resolution. He put his whole brave
heart into the effort. He wrestled with the big
and sluggish stone, as if it had been a living enemy.
He heaved, he lifted, he resolved now to succeed,
or else to perish there, and let the rock be his monument
for ever! Æthra stood gazing at him, and
clasped her hands, partly with a mother’s pride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and partly with a mother’s sorrow. The great
rock stirred! Yes, it was raised slowly from the
bedded moss and earth, uprooting the shrubs and
flowers along with it, and was turned upon its side.
Theseus had conquered!</p>

<p>While taking breath, he looked joyfully at his
mother, and she smiled upon him through her tears.</p>

<p>“Yes, Theseus,” she said, “the time has come,
and you must stay no longer at my side! See
what King Ægeus, your royal father, left for you,
beneath the stone, when he lifted it in his mighty
arms, and laid it on the spot whence you have now
removed it.”</p>

<p>Theseus looked, and saw that the rock had been
placed over another slab of stone, containing a
cavity within it; so that it somewhat resembled a
roughly-made chest or coffer, of which the upper
mass had served as the lid. Within the cavity lay
a sword, with a golden hilt, and a pair of sandals.</p>

<p>“That was your father’s sword,” said Æthra,
“and those were his sandals. When he went to be
King of Athens, he bade me treat you as a child
until you should prove yourself a man by lifting
this heavy stone. That task being accomplished,
you are to put on his sandals, in order to follow in
your father’s footsteps, and to gird on his sword,
so that you may fight giants and dragons, as King
Ægeus did in his youth.”</p>

<p>“I will set out for Athens this very day!” cried
Theseus.</p>

<p>But his mother persuaded him to stay a day or
two longer, while she got ready some necessary
articles for his journey. When his grandfather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the wise King Pittheus, heard that Theseus intended
to present himself at his father’s palace,
he earnestly advised him to get on board of a
vessel, and go by sea; because he might thus arrive
within fifteen miles of Athens, without either
fatigue or danger.</p>

<p>“The roads are very bad by land,” quoth the
venerable king; “and they are terribly infested
with robbers and monsters. A mere lad, like
Theseus, is not fit to be trusted on such a perilous
journey, all by himself. No, no; let him go by
sea!”</p>

<p>But when Theseus heard of robbers and monsters,
he pricked up his ears, and was so much the
more eager to take the road along which they were
to be met with. On the third day, therefore, he
bade a respectful farewell to his grandfather,
thanking him for all his kindness, and, after affectionately
embracing his mother, he set forth, with
a good many of her tears glistening on his cheeks,
and some, if the truth must be told, that had
gushed out of his own eyes. But he let the sun and
wind dry them, and walked stoutly on, playing
with the golden hilt of his sword, and taking very
manly strides in his father’s sandals.</p>

<p>I cannot stop to tell you hardly any of the adventures
that befell Theseus on the road to Athens.
It is enough to say, that he quite cleared that part
of the country of the robbers, about whom King
Pittheus had been so much alarmed. One of these
bad people was named Procrustes; and he was indeed
a terrible fellow, and had an ugly way of
making fun of the poor travellers who happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to fall into his clutches. In his cavern he had a
bed, on which, with great pretence of hospitality,
he invited his guests to lie down; but if they happened
to be shorter than the bed, this wicked villain
stretched them out by main force; or, if they were
too tall, he lopped off their heads or feet, and
laughed at what he had done, as an excellent joke.
Thus, however weary a man might be, he never
liked to lie in the bed of Procrustes. Another of
these robbers, named Scinis, must likewise have
been a very great scoundrel. He was in the habit
of flinging his victims off a high cliff into the sea;
and, in order to give him exactly his deserts,
Theseus tossed him off the very same place. But,
if you will believe me, the sea would not pollute
itself by receiving such a bad person into its bosom;
neither would the earth, having once got rid of him,
consent to take him back; so that, between the cliff
and the sea, Scinis stuck fast in the air, which was
forced to bear the burden of his naughtiness.</p>

<p>After these memorable deeds, Theseus heard of
an enormous sow, which ran wild, and was the terror
of all the farmers round about; and, as he did
not consider himself above doing any good thing
that came in his way, he killed this monstrous creature,
and gave the carcass to the poor people for
bacon. The great sow had been an awful beast,
while ramping about the woods and fields, but was
a pleasant object enough when cut up into joints,
and smoking on I know not how many dinner
tables.</p>

<p>Thus, by the time he reached his journey’s end
Theseus had done many valiant feats with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
father’s golden-hilted sword, and had gained the
renown of being one of the bravest young men of
the day. His fame travelled faster than he did,
and reached Athens before him. As he entered the
city, he heard the inhabitants talking at the street
comers and saying that Hercules was brave, and
Jason too, and Castor and Pollux likewise, but
that Theseus, the son of their own king, would turn
out as great a hero as the best of them. Theseus
took longer strides on hearing this, and fancied
himself sure of a magnificent reception at his
father’s court, since he came thither with Fame to
blow her trumpet before him, and cry to King
Ægeus, “Behold your son!”</p>

<p>He little suspected, innocent youth that he was,
that here in this very Athens, where his father
reigned, a greater danger awaited him than any
which he had encountered on the road. Yet this
was the truth. You must understand that the
father of Theseus, though not very old in years,
was almost worn out with the cares of government,
and had thus grown aged before his time. His
nephews, not expecting him to live a very great
while, intended to get all the power of the kingdom
into their own hands. But when they heard that
Theseus had arrived in Athens, and learned what a
gallant young man he was, they saw that he would
not be at all the kind of person to let them steal
away his father’s crown and scepter, which ought
to be his own by right of inheritance. Thus these
bad-hearted nephews of King Ægeus, who were
the own cousins of Theseus, at once became his enemies.
A still more dangerous enemy was Medea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the wicked enchantress; for she was now the king’s
wife, and wanted to give the kingdom to her son
Medus, instead of letting it be given to the son of
Æthra, whom she hated.</p>

<p>It so happened that the king’s nephews met
Theseus, and found out who he was, just as he
reached the entrance of the royal palace. With
all their evil designs against him, they pretended to
be their cousin’s best friends and expressed great
joy at making his acquaintance. They proposed
to him that he should come into the king’s presence
as a stranger, in order to try whether Ægeus would
discover in the young man’s features any likeness
either to himself or his mother Æthra, and thus
recognize him for a son. Theseus consented; for
he fancied that his father would know him in a
moment, by the love that was in his heart. But,
while he waited at the door, the nephews ran and
told King Ægeus that a young man had arrived in
Athens, who, to their certain knowledge intended
to put him to death, and get possession of his royal
crown.</p>

<p>“And he is now waiting for admission to your
majesty’s presence,” added they.</p>

<p>“Aha!” cried the old king, on hearing this.
“Why, he must be a very wicked young fellow
indeed! Pray, what would you advise me to do
with him?”</p>

<p>In reply to this question, the wicked Medea put
in her word. As I have already told you, she was a
famous enchantress. According to some stories,
she was in the habit of boiling old people in a large
caldron, under pretence of making them young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
again; but King Ægeus, I suppose, did not fancy
such an uncomfortable way of growing young, or
perhaps was contented to be old, and therefore
would never let himself be popped into the caldron.
If there were time to spare from more important
matters, I should be glad to tell you of Medea’s
fiery chariot, drawn by winged dragons, in which
the enchantress used often to take an airing among
the clouds. This chariot, in fact, was the vehicle
that first brought her to Athens, where she had done
nothing but mischief ever since her arrival. But
these and many other wonders must be left untold;
and it is enough to say that Medea, amongst a
thousand other bad things, knew how to prepare a
poison that was instantly fatal to whomsoever
might so much as touch it with his lips.</p>

<p>So when the king asked what he should do with
Theseus, this naughty woman had an answer ready
at her tongue’s end.</p>

<p>“Leave that to me, please your majesty,” she
replied. “Only admit this evil-minded young man
to your presence, treat him civilly, and invite him
to drink a goblet of wine. Your majesty is well
aware that I sometimes amuse myself with distilling
very powerful medicines. Here is one of them
in this small phial. As to what it is made of, that
is one of my secrets of state. Do but let me put a
single drop into the goblet and let the young man
taste it, and I shall answer for it, he shall quite lay
aside the bad designs with which he comes hither.”</p>

<p>As she said this, Medea smiled; but, for all her
smiling face, she meant nothing less than to poison
the poor innocent Theseus, before his father’s eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
And King Ægeus, like most other kings, thought
any punishment mild enough for a person who was
accused of plotting against his life. He therefore
made little or no objection to Medea’s scheme, and
as soon as the poisonous wine was ready, gave
orders that the young stranger should be admitted
into his presence. The goblet was set on a table
beside the king’s throne; and a fly, meaning just to
sip a little from the brim, immediately tumbled
into it, dead. Observing this, Medea looked round
at the nephews and smiled again.</p>

<p>When Theseus was ushered into the royal apartment,
the only object that he seemed to behold was
the white-bearded old king. There he sat on his
magnificent throne, a dazzling crown on his head,
and a scepter in his hand. His aspect was stately
and majestic, although his years and infirmities
weighed heavily upon him, as if each year were a
lump of lead, and each infirmity a ponderous stone,
and all were bundled up together, and laid upon his
weary shoulders. The tears both of joy and sorrow
sprang into the young man’s eyes; for he thought
how sad it was to see his dear father so infirm, and
how sweet it would be to support him with his own
youthful strength, and to cheer him up with the
alacrity of his loving spirit. When a son takes his
father into his warm heart, it renews the old man’s
youth in a better way than by the heat of Medea’s
magic caldron. And this was what Theseus resolved
to do. He could scarcely wait to see whether King
Ægeus would recognize him, so eager was he to
throw himself into his arms.</p>

<p>Advancing to the foot of the throne, he attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to make a little speech, which he had been thinking
about, as he came up the stairs. But he was almost
choked by a great many tender feelings that gushed
out of his heart and swelled into his throat, all
struggling to find utterance together. And therefore,
unless he could have laid his full, over-brimming
heart into the king’s hand, poor Theseus knew
not what to do or say. The cunning Medea observed
what was passing in the young man’s mind. She
was more wicked at that moment than ever she had
been before; for (and it makes me tremble to tell
you of it) she did her worst to turn all this unspeakable
love with which Theseus was agitated, to his
own ruin and destruction.</p>

<p>“Does your majesty see his confusion?” she whispered
in the king’s ear. “He is so conscious of
guilt, that he trembles and cannot speak. The
wretch lives too long! Quick! offer him the wine!”</p>

<p>Now King Ægeus had been gazing earnestly at
the young stranger, as he drew near the throne.
There was something, he knew not what, either in
his white brow, or in the fine expression of his
mouth, or in his beautiful and tender eyes, that
made him indistinctly feel as if he had seen this
youth before; as if, indeed, he had trotted him on
his knee when a baby, and had beheld him growing
to be a stalwart man, while he himself grew old.
But Medea guessed how the king felt, and would
not suffer him to yield to these natural sensibilities;
although they were the voice of his deepest heart,
telling him, as plainly as it could speak, that here
was our dear son, and Æthra’s son, coming to claim
him for a father. The enchantress again whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in the king’s ear, and compelled him, by her witchcraft,
to see everything under a false aspect.</p>

<p>He made up his mind, therefore, to let Theseus
drink off the poisoned wine.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said he, “you are welcome! I am
proud to show hospitality to so heroic a youth. Do
me the favor to drink the contents of this goblet.
It is brimming over, as you see, with delicious wine,
such as I bestow only on those who are worthy of it!
None is more worthy to quaff it than yourself!”</p>

<p>So saying, King Ægeus took the golden goblet
from the table, and was about to offer it to Theseus.
But, partly through his infirmities, and partly because
it seemed so sad a thing to take away this
young man’s life, however wicked he might be, and
partly, no doubt, because his heart was wiser than
his head, and quaked within him at the thought of
what he was going to do—for all these reasons, the
king’s hand trembled so much that a great deal of
the wine slopped over. In order to strengthen his
purpose, and fearing lest the whole of the precious
poison should be wasted, one of his nephews now
whispered to him—</p>

<p>“Has your majesty any doubt of this stranger’s
guilt? There is the very sword with which he meant
to slay you. How sharp, and bright, and terrible
it is. Quick!—let him taste the wine; or perhaps
he may do the deed even yet.”</p>

<p>At these words, Ægeus drove every thought and
feeling out of his breast, except the one idea how
justly the young man deserved to be put to death.
He sat erect on his throne, and held out the goblet
of wine with a steady hand, and bent on Theseus a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
frown of kingly severity; for, after all, he had too
noble a spirit to murder even a treacherous enemy
with a deceitful smile upon his face.</p>

<p>“Drink!” said he, in the stern tone with which he
was wont to condemn a criminal to be beheaded.
“You have well deserved of me such wine as this!”</p>

<p>Theseus held out his hand to take the wine. But,
before he touched it, King Ægeus trembled again.
His eyes had fallen on the gold-hilted sword that
hung at the young man’s side. He drew back the
goblet.</p>

<p>“That sword!” he exclaimed; “how came you by
it?”</p>

<p>“It was my father’s sword,” replied Theseus,
with a tremulous voice. “These were his sandals.
My dear mother (her name is Æthra) told me his
story while I was yet a little child. But it is only a
month since I grew strong enough to lift the heavy
stone, and take the sword and sandals from beneath
it, and come to Athens to seek my father.”</p>

<p>“My son! my son!” cried King Ægeus, flinging
away the fatal goblet, and tottering down from the
throne to fall into the arms of Theseus. “Yes, these
are Æthra’s eyes. It is my son.”</p>

<p>I have quite forgotten what became of the king’s
nephews. But when the wicked Medea saw this
new turn of affairs, she hurried out of the room,
and going to her private chamber, lost no time in
setting her enchantments at work. In a few
moments she heard a great noise of hissing snakes
outside of the chamber window; and, behold! there
was her fiery chariot, and four huge winged serpents,
wriggling and twisting in the air, flourishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
their tails higher than the top of the palace,
and all ready to set off on an aërial journey. Medea
stayed only long enough to take her son with her,
and to steal the crown jewels, together with the
king’s best robes, and whatever other valuable
things she could lay her hands on; and getting into
the chariot, she whipped up the snakes, and
ascended high over the city.</p>

<p>The king, hearing the hiss of the serpents,
scrambled as fast as he could to the window, and
bawled out to the abominable enchantress never to
come back. The whole people of Athens, too, who
had run out of doors to see this wonderful spectacle,
set up a shout of joy at the prospect of getting rid
of her. Medea, almost bursting with rage, uttered
precisely such a hiss as one of her own snakes, only
ten times more venomous and spiteful; and glaring
fiercely out of the blaze of the chariot, she shook
her hands over the multitude below, as if she were
scattering a million of curses among them. In so
doing, however, she unintentionally let fall about
five hundred diamonds of the first water, together
with a thousand great pearls, and two thousand
emeralds, rubies, sapphires, opals, and topazes, to
which she had helped herself out of the king’s
strong-box. All these came pelting down, like a
shower of many-colored hailstones, upon the heads
of grown people and children, who forthwith
gathered them up, and carried them back to the
palace. But King Ægeus told them that they were
welcome to the whole, and to twice as many more,
if he had them, for the sake of his delight at finding
his son, and losing the wicked Medea. And, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
if you had seen how hateful was her last look, as
the flaming chariot flew upward, you would not
have wondered that both king and people should
think her departure a good riddance.</p>

<p>And now Prince Theseus was taken into great
favor by his royal father. The old king was never
weary of having him sit beside him on his throne,
(which was quite wide enough for two), and of
hearing him tell about his dear mother, and his
childhood, and his many boyish efforts to lift the
ponderous stone. Theseus, however, was much too
brave and active a young man to be willing to spend
all his time in relating things which had already
happened. His ambition was to perform other and
more heroic deeds, which should be better worth
telling in prose and verse. Nor had he been long
in Athens before he caught and chained a terrible
mad bull, and made a public show of him, greatly
to the wonder and admiration of good King Ægeus
and his subjects. But pretty soon he undertook an
affair that made all his foregone adventures seem
like mere boy’s play. The occasion of it was as
follows:—</p>

<p>One morning, when Prince Theseus awoke, he
fancied that he must have had a very sorrowful
dream, and that it was still running in his mind,
even now that his eyes were open. For it appeared
as if the air was full of a melancholy wail; and
when he listened more attentively, he could hear
sobs, and groans, and screams of woe, mingled with
deep, quiet sighs, which came from the king’s
palace, and from the streets, and from the temples,
and from every habitation in the city. And all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
these mournful noises, issuing out of thousands of
separate hearts, united themselves into the one
great sound of affliction, which had startled Theseus
from slumber. He put on his clothes as quickly as
he could (not forgetting his sandals and gold-hilted
sword), and hastening to the king, inquired what
it all meant.</p>

<p>“Alas! my son,” quoth King Ægeus, heaving a
long sigh, “here is a very lamentable matter in
hand. This is the woefulest anniversary in the whole
year. It is the day when we annually draw lots to
see which of the youths and maidens of Athens shall
go to be devoured by the horrible Minotaur!”</p>

<p>“The Minotaur!” exclaimed Prince Theseus; and
like a brave young prince as he was, he put his
hand to the hilt of his sword. “What kind of a
monster may that be? Is it not possible, at the
risk of one’s life, to slay him?”</p>

<p>But King Ægeus shook his venerable head, and
to convince Theseus that it was quite a hopeless
case, he gave him an explanation of the whole affair.
It seems that in the island of Crete there lived a
certain dreadful monster, called a Minotaur, which
was shaped partly like a man and partly like a bull,
and was altogether such a hideous sort of a creature
that it is really disagreeable to think of him. If he
were suffered to exist at all, it should have been on
some desert island, or in the duskiness of some deep
cavern, where nobody would ever be tormented by
his abominable aspect. But King Minos, who
reigned over Crete, laid out a vast deal of money in
building a habitation for the Minotaur, and took
great care of his health and comfort, merely for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
mischief’s sake. A few years before this time, there
had been a war between the city of Athens and the
island of Crete, in which the Athenians were beaten
and compelled to beg for peace. No peace could
they obtain, however, except on condition that they
should send seven young men and seven maidens,
every year, to be devoured by the pet monster of
the cruel King Minos. For three years past, this
grievous calamity had been borne. And the sobs,
and groans, and shrieks, with which the city was
now filled, were caused by the people’s woe, because
the fatal day had come again, when the fourteen
victims were to be chosen by lot, and the old people
feared lest their sons or daughters might be taken,
and the youths and damsels dreaded lest they themselves
might be destined to glut the ravenous maw
of that detestable man-brute.</p>

<p>But when Theseus heard the story, he straightened
himself up, so that he seemed taller than ever
before; and as for his face, it was indignant, despiteful,
bold, tender, and compassionate, all in one look.</p>

<p>“Let the people of Athens, this year, draw lots
for only six young men, instead of seven,” said he.
“I will myself be the seventh; and let the Minotaur
devour me, if he can!”</p>

<p>“O my dear son,” cried King Ægeus, “why
should you expose yourself to this horrible fate?
You are a royal prince, and have a right to hold
yourself above the destinies of common men.”</p>

<p>“It is because I am a prince, your son, and the
rightful heir of your kingdom, that I freely take
upon me the calamity of your subjects,” answered
Theseus. “And you, my father, being king over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
this people, and answerable to heaven for their welfare,
are bound to sacrifice what is dearest to you,
rather than that the son or daughter of the poorest
citizen should come to any harm.”</p>

<p>The old king shed tears, and besought Theseus
not to leave him desolate in his old age, more especially
as he had but just begun to know the happiness
of possessing a good and valiant son. Theseus,
however, felt that he was in the right, and therefore
would not give up his resolution. But he assured
his father that he did not intend to be eaten up,
unresistingly, like a sheep, and that, if the Minotaur
devoured him, it should not be without a battle for
his dinner. And finally, since he could not help it,
King Ægeus consented to let him go. So a vessel
was got ready, and rigged with black sails; and
Theseus, with six other young men, and seven
tender and beautiful damsels, came down to the
harbor to embark. A sorrowful multitude accompanied
them to the shore. There was the poor old
king, too, leaning on his son’s arm, and looking as
if his single heart held all the grief of Athens.</p>

<p>Just as Prince Theseus was going on board, his
father bethought himself of one last word to say.</p>

<p>“My beloved son,” said he, grasping the prince’s
hand, “you observe that the sails of this vessel are
black; as indeed they ought to be, since it goes upon
a voyage of sorrow and despair. Now, being
weighed down with infirmities, I know not whether
I can survive till the vessel shall return. But, as
long is I do live, I shall creep daily to the top of
yonder cliff, to watch if there be a sail upon the
sea. And, dearest Theseus, if, by some happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
chance, you should escape the jaws of the Minotaur,
then tear down those dismal sails, and hoist others
that shall be bright as the sunshine. Beholding
them on the horizon, myself and all the people will
know that you are coming back victorious, and will
welcome you with such a festal uproar as Athens
never heard before.”</p>

<p>Theseus promised that he would do so. Then,
going on board, the mariners trimmed the vessel’s
black sails to the wind, which blew faintly off the
shore, being pretty much made up of the sighs that
everybody kept pouring forth on this melancholy
occasion. But by-and-by, when they had got fairly
out to sea, there came a stiff breeze from the north-west,
and drove them along as merrily over the
white-capped waves as if they had been going on
the most delightful errand imaginable. And though
it was a sad business enough, I rather question
whether fourteen young people, without any old
persons to keep them in order, could continue to
spend the whole time of the voyage in being miserable.
There had been some few dances upon the
undulating deck, I suspect, and some hearty bursts
of laughter, and other such unseasonable merriment
among the victims, before the high blue
mountains of Crete began to show themselves
among the far-off clouds. That sight, to be sure,
made them all very grave again.</p>

<p>Theseus stood among the sailors gazing eagerly
towards the land; although, as yet, it seemed hardly
more substantial than the clouds, amidst which the
mountains were looming up. Once or twice he
fancied that he saw a glare of some bright object, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
long way off, flinging a gleam across the waves.
“Did you see that flash of light?” he inquired of
the master of the vessel.</p>

<p>“No, prince; but I have seen it before,” answered
the master. “It came from Talus, I suppose.”</p>

<p>As the breeze came fresher just then, the master
was busy with trimming his sails, and had no more
time to answer questions. But while the vessel flew
faster and faster towards Crete, Theseus was astonished
to behold a human figure, gigantic in size,
which appeared to be striding, with a measured
movement, along the margin of the island. It
stepped from cliff to cliff, and sometimes from one
headland to another, while the sea foamed and
thundered on the shore beneath, and dashed its jets
of spray over the giant’s feet. What was still more
remarkable, whenever the sun shone on this huge
figure, it flickered and glimmered; its vast countenance,
too, had a metallic luster, and threw great
flashes of splendor through the air. The folds of
its garments, moreover, instead of waving in the
wind, fell heavily over its limbs, as if woven of some
kind of metal.</p>

<p>The nigher the vessel came, the more Theseus
wondered what this immense giant could be, and
whether it actually had life or no. For, though it
walked, and made other life-like motions, there yet
was a kind of jerk in its gait, which, together with
its brazen aspect, caused the young prince to suspect
that it was no true giant, but only a wonderful
piece of machinery. The figure looked all the more
terrible because it carried an enormous brass club
on its shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is this wonder?” Theseus asked of the
master of the vessel, who was now at leisure to
answer him.</p>

<p>“It is Talus, the Man of Brass,” said the master.</p>

<p>“And is he a live giant, or a brazen image?” asked
Theseus.</p>

<p>“That, truly,” replied the master, “is the point
which has always perplexed me. Some say, indeed,
that this Talus was hammered out for King Minos
by Vulcan himself, the skilfulest of all workers in
metal. But who ever saw a brazen image that had
sense enough to walk round an island three times a
day, as this giant walks round the island of Crete,
challenging every vessel that comes nigh the shore?
And, on the other hand, what living thing, unless
his sinews were made of brass, would not be weary
of marching eighteen hundred miles in the twenty-four
hours, as Talus does, without ever sitting down
to rest? He is a puzzler, take him how you will.”</p>

<p>Still the vessel went bounding onward; and now
Theseus could hear the brazen clangor of the giant’s
footsteps, as he trod heavily upon the sea-beaten
rocks, some of which were seen to crack and crumble
into the foamy waves beneath his weight. As they
approached the entrance of the port the giant
straddled clear across it, with a foot firmly planted
on each headland, and uplifting his club to such a
height that its butt-end was hidden in a cloud, he
stood in that formidable posture, with the sun
gleaming all over his metallic surface. There
seemed nothing else to be expected but that, the
next moment, he would fetch his great club down,
slam bang, and smash the vessel into a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pieces, without heeding how many innocent people
he might destroy; for there is seldom any mercy in
a giant, you know, and quite as little in a piece of
brass clockwork. But just when Theseus and his
companions thought the blow was coming, the
brazen lips unclosed themselves, and the figure
spoke.</p>

<p>“Whence come you, strangers?”</p>

<p>And when the ringing voice ceased, there was
just such a reverberation as you may have heard
within a great church bell, for a moment or two
after the stroke of the hammer.</p>

<p>“From Athens!” shouted the master in reply.</p>

<p>“On what errand?” thundered the Man of Brass.</p>

<p>And he whirled his club aloft more threateningly
than ever, as if he were about to smite them with a
thunderstroke right amidships, because Athens, so
little while ago, had been at war with Crete.</p>

<p>“We bring the seven youths and the seven
maidens,” answered the master, “to be devoured by
the Minotaur!”</p>

<p>“Pass!” cried the brazen giant.</p>

<p>That one loud word rolled all about the sky, while
again there was a booming reverberation within the
figure’s breast. The vessel glided between the headlands
of the port, and the giant resumed his march.
In a few moments, this wondrous sentinel was far
away, flashing in the distant sunshine, and revolving
with immense strides around the island of Crete, as
it was his never-ceasing task to do.</p>

<p>No sooner had they entered the harbor than a
party of the guards of King Minos came down to
the water side, and took charge of the fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
young men and damsels. Surrounded by these
armed warriors, Prince Theseus and his companions
were led to the king’s palace, and ushered
into his presence. Now, Minos was a stern and
pitiless king. If the figure that guarded Crete was
made of brass, then the monarch, who ruled over it,
might be thought to have a still harder metal in his
breast, and might have been called a man of iron.
He bent his shaggy brows upon the poor Athenian
victims. Any other mortal, beholding their fresh
and tender beauty, and their innocent looks, would
have felt himself sitting on thorns until he had made
every soul of them happy, by bidding them go free
as the summer wind. But this immitigable Minos
cared only to examine whether they were plump
enough to satisfy the Minotaur’s appetite. For my
part, I wish he himself had been the only victim;
and the monster would have found him a pretty
tough one.</p>

<p>One after another, King Minos called these pale
frightened youths and sobbing maidens to his footstool,
gave them each a poke in the ribs with his
scepter (to try whether they were in good flesh or
no), and dismissed them with a nod to his guards.
But when his eyes rested on Theseus, the king
looked at him more attentively, because his face
was calm and brave.</p>

<p>“Young man,” asked he, with his stern voice,
“are you not appalled at the certainty of being
devoured by this terrible Minotaur?”</p>

<p>“I have offered my life in a good cause,”
answered Theseus, “and therefore I give it freely
and gladly. But thou, King Minos, art thou not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
thyself appalled, who, year after year, hast perpetrated
this dreadful wrong, by giving seven
innocent youths and as many maidens to be devoured
by a monster? Dost thou not tremble,
wicked king, to turn thine eyes inward on thine own
heart? Sitting there on thy golden throne, and in
thy robes of majesty, I tell thee to thy face, King
Minos, thou art a more hideous monster than the
Minotaur himself!”</p>

<p>“Aha! do you think me so?” cried the king,
laughing in his cruel way. “To-morrow, at breakfast
time, you shall have an opportunity of judging
which is the greater monster, the Minotaur or
the king! Take them away, guards; and let this
free-spoken youth be the Minotaur’s first morsel!”</p>

<p>Near the king’s throne (though I had no time
to tell you so before) stood his daughter Ariadne.
She was a beautiful and tender-hearted maiden,
and looked at these poor doomed captives with very
different feelings from those of the iron-breasted
King Minos. She really wept, indeed, at the idea
of how much human happiness would be needlessly
thrown away, by giving so many young people, in
the first bloom and rose blossom of their lives, to be
eaten up by a creature who, no doubt, would have
preferred a fat ox, or even a large pig, to the
plumpest of them. And when she beheld the brave,
spirited figure of Prince Theseus bearing himself
so calmly in his terrible peril, she grew a hundred
times more pitiful than before. As the guards were
taking him away, she flung herself at the king’s
feet, and besought him to set all the captives free,
and especially this one young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Peace, foolish girl!” answered King Minos.
“What hast thou to do with an affair like this? It
is a matter of state policy, and therefore quite
beyond thy weak comprehension. Go water thy
flowers, and think no more of these Athenian
caitiffs, whom the Minotaur shall as certainly eat
up for breakfast as I will eat a partridge for my
supper.”</p>

<p>So saying, the king looked cruel enough to devour
Theseus and all the rest of the captives,
himself, had there been no Minotaur to save him
the trouble. As he would hear not another word
in their favor, the prisoners were now led away,
and clapped into a dungeon, where the jailer
advised to go to sleep as soon as possible, because
the Minotaur was in the habit of calling for breakfast
early. The seven maidens and six of the
young men soon sobbed themselves to slumber.
But Theseus was not like them. He felt conscious
that he was wiser, and braver, and stronger than
his companions, and that therefore he had the
responsibility of all their lives upon him, and must
consider whether there was no way to save them,
even in this last extremity. So he kept himself
awake, and paced to and fro across the gloomy
dungeon in which they were shut up.</p>

<p>Just before midnight, the door was softly unbarred,
and the gentle Ariadne showed herself,
with a torch in her hand.</p>

<p>“Are you awake, Prince Theseus?” she
whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Theseus. “With so little time
to live, I do not choose to waste any of it in sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then follow me,” said Ariadne, “and tread
softly.”</p>

<p>What had become of the jailer and the guards,
Theseus never knew. But, however that might be,
Ariadne opened all the doors, and led him forth
from the darksome prison into the pleasant moonlight.</p>

<p>“Theseus,” said the maiden, “you can now get
on board your vessel, and sail away for Athens.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the young man; “I will never
leave Crete unless I can first slay the Minotaur,
and save my poor companions, and deliver Athens
from this cruel tribute.”</p>

<p>“I knew that this would be your resolution,”
said Ariadne. “Come, then, with me, brave Theseus.
Here is your own sword, which the guards
deprived you of. You will need it; and pray
Heaven you may use it well.”</p>

<p>Then she led Theseus along by the hand until
they came to a dark, shadowy grove, where the
moonlight wasted itself on the tops of the trees,
without shedding hardly so much as a glimmering
beam upon their pathway. After going a good
way through this obscurity, they reached a high
marble wall, which was overgrown with creeping
plants, that made it shaggy with their verdure.
The wall seemed to have no door, nor any windows,
but rose up, lofty, and massive, and mysterious,
and was neither to be clambered over, nor, so far
as Theseus could perceive, to be passed through.
Nevertheless, Ariadne did but press one of her
soft little fingers against a particular block of
marble, and, though it looked as solid as any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
part of the wall, it yielded to her touch, disclosing
an entrance just wide enough to admit them. They
crept through, and the marble stone swung back
into its place.</p>

<p>“We are now,” said Ariadne, “in the famous
labyrinth which Dædalus built before he made himself
a pair of wings, and flew away from our island
like a bird. That Dædalus was a very cunning
workman; but of all his artful contrivances, this
labyrinth is the most wondrous. Were we to take
but a few steps from the doorway, we might
wander about all our lifetime, and never find it
again. Yet in the very center of this labyrinth is
the Minotaur and, Theseus, you must go thither to
seek him.”</p>

<p>“But how shall I ever find him,” asked Theseus,
“if the labyrinth so bewilders me as you say it
will?”</p>

<p>Just as he spoke, they heard a rough and very
disagreeable roar, which greatly resembled the lowing
of a fierce bull, but yet had some sort of sound
like the human voice. Theseus even fancied a rude
articulation in it, as if the creature that uttered it
were trying to shape his hoarse breath into words.
It was at some distance, however, and he really
could not tell whether it sounded most like a bull’s
roar or a man’s harsh voice.</p>

<p>“That is the Minotaur’s noise,” whispered
Ariadne, closely grasping the hand of Theseus, and
pressing one of her own hands to her heart, which
was all in a tremble. “You must follow that sound
through the windings of the labyrinth, and, by and
by, you will find him. Stay! take the end of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
silken string, I will hold the other end; and then,
if you win the victory, it will lead you again to this
spot. Farewell, brave Theseus.”</p>

<p>So the young man took the end of the silken
string in his left hand, and his gold-hilted sword,
ready drawn from its scabbard, in the other, and
trod boldly into the inscrutable labyrinth. How
this labyrinth was built is more than I can tell you,
but so cunningly contrived a mizmaze was never
seen in the world, before nor since. There can be
nothing else so intricate, unless it were the brain
of a man like Dædalus, who planned it, or the heart
of any ordinary man; which last, to be sure, is ten
times as great a mystery as the labyrinth of Crete.
Theseus had not taken five steps before he lost
sight of Ariadne and in five more his head was
growing dizzy. But still he went on, now creeping
through a low arch, now ascending a flight of steps,
now in one crooked passage, and now in another,
with here a door opening before him, and there one
hanging behind, until it really seemed as if the
walls spun round, and whirled him round along
with them. And all the while, through these
hollow avenues, now nearer, now farther off again,
resounded the cry of the Minotaur; and the sound
was so fierce, so cruel, so ugly, so like a bull’s roar,
and withal so like a human voice, and yet like
neither of them, that the brave heart of Theseus
grew sterner and angrier at every step; for he felt
it an insult to the moon and sky, and to our affectionate
and simple Mother Earth, that such a monster
should have the audacity to exist.</p>

<p>As he passed onward, the clouds gathered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the moon, and the labyrinth grew so dusky that
Theseus could no longer discern the bewilderment
through which he was passing. He would have
felt quite lost, and utterly hopeless of ever again
walking in a straight path, if, every little while,
he had not been conscious of a gentle twitch at the
silken cord. Then he knew that the tender-hearted
Ariadne was still holding the other end, and that
she was fearing for him, and hoping for him, and
giving him just as much of her sympathy as if she
were close by his side. Oh, indeed, I can assure
you, there, was a vast deal of human sympathy
running along that slender thread of silk. But
still he followed the dreadful roar of the Minotaur,
which now grew louder and louder, and finally so
very loud that Theseus fully expected to come
close upon him, at every new zigzag and wriggle
of the path. And at last, in an open space, at the
very center of the labyrinth, he did discern the
hideous creature.</p>

<p>Sure enough, what an ugly monster it was!
Only his horned head belonged to a bull; and yet,
somehow or other, he looked like a bull all over,
preposterously waddling on his hind legs; or, if
you happened to view him in another way, he
seemed wholly a man, and all the more monstrous
for being so. And there he was, the wretched
thing, with no society, no companion, no kind of a
mate, living only to do mischief, and incapable of
knowing what affection means. Theseus hated
him, and shuddered at him, and yet could not but
be sensible of some sort of pity; and all the more,
the uglier and more detestable the creature was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
For he kept striding to and fro, in a solitary
frenzy of rage, continually emitting a hoarse roar,
which was oddly mixed up with half-shaped words;
and, after listening a while, Theseus understood
that the Minotaur was saying to himself how
miserable he was, and how hungry, and how he
hated everybody, and how he longed to eat up the
human race alive.</p>

<p>Ah, the bull-headed villain! And oh, my good
little people, you will perhaps see, one of these
days, as I do now, that every human being who
suffers anything evil to get into his nature, or to
remain there, is a kind of Minotaur, an enemy of
his fellow-creatures, and separated from all good
companionship, as this poor monster was.</p>

<p>Was Theseus afraid? By no means, my dear
auditors. What! a hero like Theseus afraid! Not
had the Minotaur had twenty bull heads instead of
one. Bold as he was, however, I rather fancy that
it strengthened his valiant heart, just at this crisis,
to feel a tremulous twitch at the silken cord, which
he was still holding in his left hand. It was as
if Ariadne were giving him all her might and
courage; and, much as he already had, and little
as she had to give, it made his own seem twice as
much. And to confess the honest truth, he needed
the whole, for now the Minotaur, turning suddenly
about, caught sight of Theseus, and instantly
lowered his horribly sharp horns, exactly as a mad
bull does when he means to rush against an enemy.
At the same time, he belched forth a tremendous
roar, in which there was something like the words
of human language, but all disjointed and shaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to pieces by passing through the gullet of a miserably
enraged brute.</p>

<p>Theseus could only guess what the creature
intended to say, and that rather by his gestures
than his words, for the Minotaur’s horns were
sharper than his wits, and of a great deal more
service to him than his tongue. But probably this
was the sense of what he uttered:</p>

<p>“Ah, wretch of a human being! I’ll stick my
horns through you, and toss you fifty feet high, and
eat you up the moment you come down.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then, and try it!” was all that
Theseus deigned to reply; for he was far too magnanimous
to assault his enemy with insolent
language.</p>

<p>Without more words on either side, there ensued
the most awful fight between Theseus and the
Minotaur that ever happened beneath the sun or
moon. I really know not how it might have turned
out, if the monster, in his first headlong rush
against Theseus, had not missed him, by a hair’s
breadth, and broken one of his horns short off
against the stone wall. On this mishap he bellowed
so intolerably that a part of the labyrinth tumbled
down, and all the inhabitants of Crete mistook the
noise for an uncommonly heavy thunder-storm.
Smarting with the pain, he galloped around the
open space in so ridiculous a way that Theseus
laughed at it, long afterwards, though not precisely
at the moment. After this, the two antagonists
stood valiantly up to one another, and fought sword
to horn, for a long while. At last, the Minotaur
made a run at Theseus, grazed his left side with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his horn, and flung him down; and thinking that he
had stabbed him to the heart, he cut a great caper
in the air, opened his bull mouth from ear to ear,
and prepared to snap his head off. But Theseus
by this time had leaped up, and caught the monster
off his guard. Fetching a sword stroke at him with
all his force, he hit him fair upon the neck, and
made his bull head skip six yards from his human
body, which fell down flat upon the ground.</p>

<p>So now the battle was ended. Immediately the
moon shone out as brightly as if all the troubles
of the world, and all the wickedness and the ugliness
that infest human life, were past and gone
forever. And Theseus, as he leaned on his sword
taking breath, felt another twitch of the silken
cord; for all through the terrible encounter, he had
held it fast in his left hand. Eager to let Ariadne
know of his success, he followed the guidance of
the thread, and soon found himself at the entrance
of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>“Thou hast slain the monster,” cried Ariadne,
clasping her hands.</p>

<p>“Thanks to thee, dear Ariadne,” answered
Theseus, “I return victorious.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Ariadne, “we must quickly summon
thy friends, and get them and thyself on board
the vessel before dawn. If morning finds thee here,
my father will avenge the Minotaur.”</p>

<p>To make my story short, the poor captives were
awakened, and, hardly knowing whether it was not
a joyful dream, were told of what Theseus had
done, and that they must set sail for Athens before
daybreak. Hastening down to the vessel, they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
clambered on board, except Prince Theseus, who
lingered behind them on the strand, holding
Ariadne’s hand clasped in his own.</p>

<p>“Dear maiden,” said he, “thou wilt surely go
with us. Thou art too gentle and sweet a child for
such an iron-hearted father as King Minos. He
cares no more for thee than a granite rock cares
for the little flower that grows in one of its crevices.
But my father King Ægeus, and my dear
mother, Æthra, and all the fathers and mothers in
Athens, and all the sons and daughters too, will
love and honor thee as their benefactress. Come
with us, then; for King Minos will be very angry
when he knows what thou hast done.”</p>

<p>Now, some low-minded people, who pretend to
tell the story of Theseus and Ariadne, have the
face to say that this royal and honorable maiden
did really flee away, under cover of the night, with
the young stranger whose life she had preserved.
They say, too, that Prince Theseus (who could
have died sooner than wrong the meanest creature
in the world) ungratefully deserted Ariadne on a
solitary island, where the vessel touched on its
voyage to Athens. But, had the noble Theseus
heard these falsehoods, he would have served their
slanderous authors as he served the Minotaur!
Here is what Ariadne answered, when the brave
Prince of Athens besought her to accompany him:</p>

<p>“No, Theseus,” the maiden said, pressing his
hand, and then drawing back a step or two, “I cannot
go with you. My father is old, and has nobody
but myself to love him. Hard as you think his
heart is, it would break to lose me. At first, King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Minos will be angry; but he will soon forgive his
only child; and, by and by, he will rejoice, I know,
that no more youths and maidens must come from
Athens to be devoured by the Minotaur. I have
saved you, Theseus, as much for my father’s sake
as for your own. Farewell! Heaven bless you!”</p>

<p>All this was so true, and so maiden-like, and was
spoken with so sweet a dignity, that Theseus
would have blushed to urge her any longer. Nothing
remained for him, therefore, but to bid Ariadne
an affectionate farewell, and to go on board the
vessel, and set sail.</p>

<p>In a few moments the white foam was boiling up
before their prow, as Prince Theseus and his companions
sailed out of the harbor, with a whistling
breeze behind them. Talus, the brazen giant, on
his never-ceasing sentinel’s march, happened to be
approaching that part of the coast; and they saw
him, by the glimmering of the moonbeams on his
polished surface, while he was yet a great way off.
As the figure moved like clockwork, however, and
could neither hasten his enormous strides nor retard
them, he arrived at the port when they were just
beyond the reach of his club. Nevertheless, straddling
from headland to headland, as his custom
was, Talus attempted to strike a blow at the vessel,
and, overreaching himself, tumbled at full length
into the sea, which splashed high over his gigantic
shape, as when an iceberg turns a somerset. There
he lies yet; and whoever desires to enrich himself
by means of brass had better go thither with a diving
bell, and fish up Talus.</p>

<p>On the homeward voyage, the fourteen youths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and damsels were in excellent spirits, as you will
easily suppose. They spent most of their time in
dancing, unless when the sidelong breeze made the
deck slope too much. In due season, they came
within sight of the coast of Attica, which was their
native country. But here, I am grieved to tell you,
happened a sad misfortune.</p>

<p>You will remember (what Theseus unfortunately
forgot) that his father, King Ægeus, had
enjoined it upon him to hoist sunshiny sails, instead
of black ones, in case he should overcome the
Minotaur, and return victorious. In the joy of
their success, however, and amidst the sports, dancing,
and other merriment, with which these young
folks wore away the time, they never once thought
whether their sails were black, white, or rainbow
colored, and, indeed, left it entirely to the
mariners whether they had any sails at all. Thus
the vessel returned, like a raven, with the same
sable wings that had wafted her away. But poor
King Ægeus, day after day, infirm as he was, had
clambered to the summit of a cliff that overhung
the sea, and there sat watching for Prince Theseus,
homeward bound; and no sooner did he behold the
fatal blackness of the sails, than he concluded that
his dear son, whom he loved so much, and felt so
proud of, had been eaten by the Minotaur. He
could not bear the thought of living any longer;
so, first flinging his crown and scepter into the sea
(useless baubles that they were to him now!)
King Ægeus merely stooped forward, and fell
headlong over the cliff, and was drowned, poor
soul, in the waves that foamed at its base!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>This was melancholy news for Prince Theseus,
who when he stepped ashore, found himself king
of all the country, whether he would or no; and
such a turn of fortune was enough to make any
young man feel very much out of spirits. However,
he sent for his dear mother to Athens, and,
by taking her advice in matters of state, became a
very excellent monarch, and was greatly beloved
by his people.</p>

<h3 id="PEGASUS_THE_WINGED_HORSE">PEGASUS, THE WINGED HORSE</h3>

<p class="author">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once, in the old, old times a fountain gushed
out of a hill-side, in the marvellous land of
Greece. And, for aught I know, after so many
thousand years, it is still gushing out of the very
selfsame spot. At any rate, there was the pleasant
fountain, welling freshly forth and sparkling
adown the hill-side, in the golden sunset, when a
handsome young man named Bellerophon drew
near its margin. In his hand he held a bridle,
studded with brilliant gems, and adorned with a
golden bit. Seeing an old man, and another of
middle age, and a little boy, near the fountain, and
likewise a maiden, who was dipping up some of the
water in a pitcher, he paused, and begged that he
might refresh himself with a draught.</p>

<p>“This is very delicious water,” he said to the
maiden as he rinsed and filled her pitcher, after
drinking out of it. “Will you be kind enough to
tell me whether the fountain has any name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; it is called the Fountain of Pirene,”
answered the maiden; and then she added, “My
grandmother has told me that this clear fountain
was once a beautiful woman; and when her son was
killed by the arrows of the huntress Diana, she
melted all away into tears. And so the water,
which you find so cool and sweet, is the sorrow of
that poor mother’s heart!”</p>

<p>“I should not have dreamed,” observed the
young stranger, “that so clear a well-spring with
its gush and gurgle, and its cheery dance out of the
shade into the sunlight, had so much as one tear-drop
in its bosom! And this, then, is Pirene?
I thank you, pretty maiden, for telling me its name.
I have come from a far-away country to find this
very spot.”</p>

<p>A middle-aged country fellow (he had driven his
cow to drink out of the spring) stared hard at
young Bellerophon, and at the handsome bridle
which he carried in his hand.</p>

<p>“The water-courses must be getting low, friend,
in your part of the world,” remarked he, “if you
come so far only to find the Fountain of Pirene.
But, pray, have you lost a horse? I see you carry
the bridle in your hand; and a very pretty one it
is with that double row of bright stones upon it.
If the horse was as fine as the bridle, you are much
to be pitied for losing him.”</p>

<p>“I have lost no horse,” said Bellerophon, with
a smile. “But I happen to be seeking a very famous
one, which, as wise people have informed me, must
be found hereabouts, if anywhere. Do you know
whether the winged horse Pegasus still haunts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Fountain of Pirene, as he used to do in your forefathers’
days?”</p>

<p>But then the country fellow laughed.</p>

<p>Some of you, my little friends, have probably
heard that this Pegasus was a snow-white steed,
with beautiful silvery wings, who spent most of
his time on the summit of Mount Helicon. He
was as wild, and as swift, and as buoyant, in his
flight through the air, as any eagle that ever soared
into the clouds. There was nothing else like him in
the world. He had no mate; he never had been
backed or bridled by a master; and, for many a
long year, he led a solitary and a happy life.</p>

<p>Oh, how fine a thing it is to be a winged horse!
Sleeping at night, as he did, on a lofty mountain-top,
and passing the greater part of the day in the
air, Pegasus seemed hardly to be a creature of the
earth. Whenever he was seen, up very high above
people’s heads, with the sunshine on his silvery
wings, you would have thought that he belonged to
the sky, and that, skimming a little too low, he had
got astray among our mists and vapors, and was
seeking his way back again. It was very pretty
to behold him plunge into the fleecy bosom of a
bright cloud, and be lost in it, for a moment or
two, and then break forth from the other side. Or,
in a sullen rainstorm, when there was a gray
pavement of clouds over the whole sky, it would
sometimes happen that the winged horse descended
right through it, and the glad light of the upper
region would gleam after him. In another instant,
it is true, both Pegasus and the pleasant light would
be gone away together. But any one that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fortunate enough to see this wondrous spectacle felt
cheerful the whole day afterward, and as much
longer as the storm lasted.</p>

<p>In the summer-time and in the beautifulest of
weather, Pegasus often alighted on the solid earth,
and, closing his silvery wings, would gallop over hill
and dale for pastime as fleetly as the wind. Oftener
than in any other place, he had been seen near the
Fountain of Pirene, drinking the delicious water,
or rolling himself upon the soft grass of the margin.
Sometimes, too (but Pegasus was very dainty in
his food), he would crop a few of the clover-blossoms
that happened to be sweetest.</p>

<p>To the Fountain of Pirene, therefore, people’s
great-grandfathers had been in the habit of going
(as long as they were youthful, and retained their
faith in winged horses), in hopes of getting a
glimpse at the beautiful Pegasus. But, of late
years, he had been very seldom seen. Indeed,
there were many of the country folks, dwelling
within half an hour’s walk of the fountain, who had
never beheld Pegasus, and did not believe that
there was any such creature in existence. The
country fellow to whom Bellerophon was speaking
chanced to be one of those incredulous persons.</p>

<p>And that was the reason why he laughed.</p>

<p>“Pegasus, indeed!” cried he, turning up his nose
as high as such a flat nose could be turned up—“Pegasus,
indeed! A winged horse, truly! Why,
friend, are you in your senses? Of what use would
wings be to a horse? Could he drag the plow so
well, think you? To be sure, there might be a little
saving in the expense of shoes; but then, how would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a man like to see his horse flying out of the stable
window?—yes, or whisking him up above the clouds,
when he only wanted to ride to the mill? No, no! I
don’t believe in Pegasus. There never was such a
ridiculous kind of a horse-fowl made!”</p>

<p>“I have some reason to think otherwise,” said
Bellerophon, quietly.</p>

<p>And then he turned to an old gray man, who was
leaning on a staff, and listening very attentively,
with his head stretched forward, and one hand at
his ear, because, for the last twenty years, he had
been getting rather deaf.</p>

<p>“And what say you, venerable sir?” inquired he.
“In your younger days, I should imagine, you must
frequently have seen the winged steed!”</p>

<p>“Ah, young stranger, my memory is very poor!”
said the aged man. “When I was a lad, if I remember
rightly, I used to believe there was such a horse,
and so did everybody else. But nowadays, I hardly
know what to think, and very seldom think about
the winged horse at all. If I ever saw the creature,
it was a long, long while ago; and, to tell you the
truth, I doubt whether I ever did see him. One
day, to be sure, when I was quite a youth, I remember
seeing some hoof-tramps round about the brink
of the fountain. Pegasus might have made those
hoof-marks; and so might some other horse.”</p>

<p>“And have you never seen him, my fair maiden?”
asked Bellerophon of the girl, who stood with the
pitcher on her head, while this talk went on. “You
certainly could see Pegasus, if anybody can, for
your eyes are very bright.”</p>

<p>“Once I thought I saw him,” replied the maiden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with a smile and a blush. “It was either Pegasus,
or a large white bird, a very great way up in the
air. And one other time, as I was coming to the
fountain with my pitcher, I heard a neigh. Oh,
such a brisk and melodious neigh as that was! My
very heart leaped with delight at the sound. But
it startled me, nevertheless; so that I ran home
without filling my pitcher.”</p>

<p>“That was truly a pity!” said Bellerophon.</p>

<p>And he turned to the child, whom I mentioned at
the beginning of the story, and who was gazing at
him, as children are apt to gaze at strangers, with
his rosy mouth wide open.</p>

<p>“Well, my little fellow,” cried Bellerophon, playfully
pulling one of his curls, “I suppose you have
often seen the winged horse.”</p>

<p>“That I have,” answered the child, very readily.
“I saw him yesterday, and many times before.”</p>

<p>“You are a fine little man!” said Bellerophon,
drawing the child closer to him. “Come, tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied the child, “I often come here
to sail little boats in the fountain, and to gather
pretty pebbles out of its basin. And sometimes,
when I look down into the water, I see the image of
the winged horse, in the picture of the sky that is
there. I wish he would come down, and take me on
his back, and let me ride him up to the moon! But,
if I so much as stir to look at him, he flies far
away out of sight.”</p>

<p>And Bellerophon put his faith in the child, who
had seen the image of Pegasus in the water, and in
the maiden, who had heard him neigh so melodiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
rather than in the middle-aged clown, who
believed only in cart-horses, or in the old man
who had forgotten the beautiful things of his
youth.</p>

<p>Therefore, he haunted about the Fountain of
Pirene for a great many days afterward. He kept
continually on the watch, looking upward at the
sky, or else down into the water, hoping forever
that he should see either the reflected image of the
winged horse, or the marvellous reality. He held
the bridle, with its bright gems and golden bit, always
ready in his hand. The rustic people, who
dwelt in the neighborhood, and drove their cattle to
the fountain to drink, would often laugh at poor
Bellerophon, and sometimes take him pretty
severely to task. They told him that an able-bodied
young man, like himself, ought to have
better business than to be wasting his time in such
an idle pursuit. They offered to sell him a horse,
if he wanted one; and when Bellerophon declined
the purchase, they tried to drive a bargain with
him for his fine bridle.</p>

<p>Even the country boys thought him so very
foolish, that they used to have a great deal of sport
about him, and were rude enough not to care a fig,
although Bellerophon saw and heard it. One little
urchin, for example, would play Pegasus, and cut
the oddest imaginable capers, by way of flying;
while one of his school-fellows would scamper after
him, holding forth a twist of bulrushes, which was
intended to represent Bellerophon’s ornamental
bridle. But the gentle child, who had seen the
picture of Pegasus in the water, comforted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
young stranger more than all the naughty boys
could torment him. The dear little fellow, in his
play-hours, often sat down beside him, and, without
speaking a word, would look down into the
fountain and up toward the sky, with so innocent a
faith, that Bellerophon could not help feeling
encouraged.</p>

<p>Now you will, perhaps, wish to be told why it was
that Bellerophon had undertaken to catch the
winged horse. And we shall find no better opportunity
to speak about this matter than while he is
waiting for Pegasus to appear.</p>

<p>If I were to relate the whole of Bellerophon’s
previous adventures, they might easily grow into a
very long story. It will be quite enough to say,
that, in a certain country in Asia, a terrible monster,
called a Chimæra, had made its appearance,
and was doing more mischief than could be talked
about between now and sunset. According to the
best accounts which I have been able to obtain, this
Chimæra was nearly, if not quite the ugliest and
most poisonous creature, and the strangest and
unaccountablest, and the hardest to fight with,
and the most difficult to run away from, that ever
came out of the earth’s inside. It had a tail like
a boa-constrictor; its body was like I do not care
what; and it had three separate heads, one of which
was a lion’s, the second a goat’s, and the third an
abominably great snake’s. And a hot blast of fire
came flaming out of each of its three mouths!
Being an earthly monster, I doubt whether it had
any wings; but, wings or no, it ran like a goat and
a lion, and wriggled along like a serpent, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
contrived to make about as much speed as all the
three together.</p>

<p>Oh, the mischief, and mischief, and mischief that
this naughty creature did! With its flaming
breath, it could set a forest on fire, or burn up a
field of grain, or, for that matter, a village, with
all its fences and houses. It laid waste the whole
country round about, and used to eat up people
and animals alive, and cook them afterward in the
burning oven of its stomach. Mercy on us, little
children, I hope neither you nor I will ever happen
to meet a Chimæra!</p>

<p>While the hateful beast (if a beast we can anywise
call it) was doing all these horrible things, it
so chanced that Bellerophon came to that part of
the world, on a visit to the king. The king’s name
was Iobates, and Lycia was the country which he
ruled over. Bellerophon was one of the bravest
youths in the world, and desired nothing so much
as to do some valiant and beneficent deed, such
as would make all mankind admire and love him.
In those days, the only way for a young man to
distinguish himself was by fighting battles, either
with the enemies of his country, or with wicked
giants, or with troublesome dragons, or with wild
beasts, when he could find nothing more dangerous
to encounter.</p>

<p>King Iobates perceiving the courage of his
youthful visitor, proposed to him to go and fight
the Chimæra, which everybody else was afraid
of, and which, unless it should be soon killed, was
likely to convert Lycia into a desert. Bellerophon
hesitated not a moment, but assured the king that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he would either slay this dreaded Chimæra, or
perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>But, in the first place, as the monster was so prodigiously
swift, he bethought himself that he should
never win the victory by fighting on foot. The
wisest thing he could do, therefore, was to get the
very best and fleetest horse that could anywhere
be found. And what other horse, in all the world,
was half so fleet as the marvellous horse Pegasus,
who had wings as well as legs, and was even more
active in the air than on the earth? To be sure, a
great many people denied that there was any such
horse with wings, and said that the stories about
him were all poetry and nonsense. But, wonderful
as it appeared, Bellerophon believed that Pegasus
was a real steed, and hoped that he himself might
be fortunate enough to find him; and, once fairly
mounted on his back, he would be able to fight the
Chimæra at better advantage.</p>

<p>And this was the purpose with which he had
travelled from Lycia to Greece, and had brought
the beautifully ornamental bridle in his hand. It
was an enchanted bridle. If he could only succeed
in putting the golden bit into the mouth of Pegasus,
the winged horse would be submissive, and would
own Bellerophon for his master, and fly whithersoever
he might choose to turn the rein.</p>

<p>But, indeed, it was a weary and anxious time,
while Bellerophon waited and waited for Pegasus,
in hopes that he would come and drink at the
Fountain of Pirene. He was afraid lest King
Iobates should imagine that he had fled from the
Chimæra. It pained him, too, to think how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
mischief the monster was doing, while he himself,
instead of fighting with it, was compelled to sit
idly poring over the bright waters of Pirene, as
they gushed out of the sparkling sand. And as
Pegasus came thither so seldom in these latter
years, and scarcely alighted there more than once
in a lifetime, Bellerophon feared that he might
grow an old man, and have no strength left in his
arms nor courage in his heart, before the winged
horse would appear. Oh, how heavily passes the
time, while an adventurous youth is yearning to do
his part in life and to gather in the harvest of his
renown! How hard a lesson it is to wait! Our life
is brief, and how much of it is spent in teaching us
only this!</p>

<p>Well was it for Bellerophon that the gentle
child had grown so fond of him, and was
never weary of keeping him company. Every
morning the child gave him a new hope to
put in his bosom, instead of yesterday’s withered
one.</p>

<p>“Dear Bellerophon,” he would cry, looking up
hopefully into his face, “I think we shall see
Pegasus to-day!”</p>

<p>And, at length, if it had not been for the little
boy’s unwavering faith, Bellerophon would have
given up all hope, and would have gone back to
Lycia, and have done his best to slay the Chimæra
without the help of the winged horse. And in that
case poor Bellerophon would at least have been terribly
scorched by the creature’s breath, and would
most probably have been killed and devoured.
Nobody should ever try to fight an earth-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Chimæra, unless he can first get upon the back of
an aërial steed.</p>

<p>One morning the child spoke to Bellerophon even
more hopefully than usual.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear Bellerophon,” cried he, “I know not
why it is, but I feel as if we should certainly see
Pegasus to-day!”</p>

<p>And all that day he would not stir a step from
Bellerophon’s side; so they ate a crust of bread
together and drank some of the water of the fountain.
In the afternoon, there they sat, and Bellerophon
had thrown his arm around the child, who
likewise had put one of his little hands into Bellerophon’s.</p>

<p>The latter was lost in his own thoughts, and
was fixing his eyes vacantly on the trunks of the
trees that overshadowed the fountain, and on the
grapevines that clambered up among their branches.
But the gentle child was gazing down into the
water; he was grieved, for Bellerophon’s sake, that
the hope of another day should be deceived, like
so many before it; and two or three quiet tear-drops
fell from his eyes, and mingled with what were said
to be the many tears of Pirene, when she wept
for her slain children.</p>

<p>But, when he least thought of it, Bellerophon
felt the pressure of the child’s little hand, and
heard a soft, almost breathless, whisper.</p>

<p>“See there, dear Bellerophon! There is an image
in the water!”</p>

<p>The young man looked down into the dimpling
mirror of the fountain, and saw what he took to be
the reflection of a bird which seemed to be flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
at a great height in the air, with a gleam of sunshine
on its snowy or silvery wings.</p>

<p>“What a splendid bird it must be!” said he.
“And how very large it looks, though it must really
be flying higher than the clouds!”</p>

<p>“It makes me tremble!” whispered the child. “I
am afraid to look up into the air! It is very beautiful,
and yet I dare only look at its image in the
water. Dear Bellerophon, do you not see that it is
no bird? It is the winged horse Pegasus!”</p>

<p>Bellerophon’s heart began to throb! He gazed
keenly upward, but could not see the winged
creature, whether bird or horse; because, just then,
it had plunged into the fleecy depths of a summer
cloud. It was but a moment, however, before the
object reappeared, sinking lightly down out of the
cloud, although still at a vast distance from the
earth.</p>

<p>Bellerophon caught the child in his arms, and
shrank back with him, so that they were both hidden
among the thick shrubbery which grew all around
the fountain. Not that he was afraid of any harm,
but he dreaded lest, if Pegasus caught a glimpse of
them, he would fly far away, and alight in some
inaccessible mountain-top. For it was really the
winged horse. After they had expected him so
long, he was coming to quench his thirst with the
water of Pirene.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the aërial wonder, flying
in great circles, as you may have seen a dove when
about to alight. Downward came Pegasus, in those
wide, sweeping circles, which grew narrower, and
narrower still, as he gradually approached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
earth. The nigher the view of him, the more
beautiful he was, and the more marvellous the
sweep of his silvery wings. At last, with so light
a pressure as hardly to bend the grass about the
fountain, or imprint a hoof-tramp in the sand of its
margin, he alighted, and, stooping his wild head,
began to drink. He drew in the water, with long
and pleasant sighs, and tranquil pauses of enjoyment;
and then another draught, and another, and
another. For, nowhere in the world, or up among
the clouds, did Pegasus love any water as he loved
this of Pirene. And when his thirst was slaked, he
cropped a few of the honey-blossoms of the clover,
delicately tasting them, but not caring to make a
hearty meal, because the herbage, just beneath the
clouds, on the lofty sides of Mount Helicon, suited
his palate better than this ordinary grass.</p>

<p>After thus drinking to his heart’s content, and
in his dainty fashion, condescending to take a little
food, the winged horse began to caper to and fro,
and dance as it were, out of mere idleness and sport.
There never was a more playful creature made than
this very Pegasus. So there he frisked, in a way
that it delights me to think about, fluttering his
great wings as lightly as ever did a linnet, and running
little races, half on earth and half in the air,
and which I know not whether to call a flight or a
gallop. When a creature is perfectly able to fly,
he sometimes chooses to run, just for the pastime
of the thing; and so did Pegasus, although it cost
him some little trouble to keep his hoofs so near
the ground. Bellerophon, meanwhile, holding the
child’s hand, peeped forth from the shrubbery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and thought that never was any sight so beautiful
as this, nor ever a horse’s eyes so wild and spirited
as those of Pegasus. It seemed a sin to think of
bridling him and riding on his back.</p>

<p>Once or twice Pegasus stopped, and snuffed the
air, pricking up his ears, tossing his head, and turning
it on all sides, as if he partly suspected some
mischief or other. Seeing nothing, however, and
hearing no sound, he soon began his antics again.</p>

<p>At length—not that he was weary, but only idle
and luxurious—Pegasus folded his wings, and lay
down on the soft green turf. But, being too full
of aërial life to remain quiet for many moments
together, he soon rolled over on his back, with his
four slender legs in the air. It was beautiful to
see him, this one solitary creature, whose mate had
never been created, but who needed no companion,
and, living a great many hundred years, was as
happy as the centuries were long. The more he
did such things as mortal horses are accustomed to
do, the less earthly and the more wonderful he
seemed. Bellerophon and the child almost held their
breath, partly from a delightful awe, but still more
because they dreaded lest the slightest stir or murmur
should send him up, with the speed of an
arrow-flight, into the furthest blue of the sky.</p>

<p>Finally, when he had enough of rolling over
and over, Pegasus turned himself about, and, indolently,
like any other horse, put out his fore legs, in
order to rise from the ground; and Bellerophon,
who had guessed that he would do so, darted suddenly
from the thicket, and leaped astride of his
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, there he sat, on the back of the winged
horse!</p>

<p>But what a bound did Pegasus make, when for
the first time, he felt the weight of a mortal man
upon his loins! A bound, indeed! Before he had
time to draw a breath, Bellerophon found himself
five hundred feet aloft, and still shooting upward,
while the winged horse snorted and trembled with
terror and anger. Upward he went, up, up, up,
until he plunged into the cold misty bosom of a
cloud, at which, only a little while before, Bellerophon
had been gazing, and fancying it a very pleasant
spot. Then again, out of the heart of the cloud,
Pegasus shot down like a thunderbolt, as if he
meant to dash both himself and his rider headlong
against a rock. Then he went through about a
thousand of the wildest caprioles that had ever been
performed either by a bird or a horse.</p>

</div>

<p>I cannot tell you half that he did. He skimmed
straight forward, and sidewise, and backward. He
reared himself erect, with his fore legs on a wreath
of mist, and his hind legs on nothing at all. He
flung out his heels behind, and put down his head
between his legs, with his wings pointing right
upward. At about two miles’ height above the
earth, he turned a somerset, so that Bellerophon’s
heels were where his head should have been, and
he seemed to look down into the sky instead of up.
He twisted his head about, and, looking Bellerophon
in the face, with fire flashing from his eyes,
made a terrible attempt to bite him. He fluttered
his pinions so wildly that one of the silver feathers
was shaken out, and floating earthward, was picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
up by the child, who kept it as long as he lived, in
memory of Pegasus and Bellerophon.</p>

<p>But the latter (who, as you may judge, was as
good a horseman as ever galloped) had been watching
his opportunity, and at last clapped the golden
bit of the enchanted bridle between the winged
steed’s jaws. No sooner was this done, than
Pegasus became as manageable as if he had taken
food, all his life, out of Bellerophon’s hand. To
speak what I really feel, it was almost a sadness to
see so wild a creature grow suddenly so tame. And
Pegasus seemed to feel it so, likewise. He looked
round to Bellerophon, with the tears in his beautiful
eyes, instead of the fire that so recently flashed from
them. But when Bellerophon patted his head, and
spoke a few authoritative, yet kind and soothing
words, another look came into the eyes of Pegasus;
for he was glad at heart, after so many lonely centuries,
to have found a companion and a master.</p>

<p>Thus it always is with winged horses, and with
all such wild and solitary creatures. If you can
catch and overcome them, it is the surest way to
win their love.</p>

<p>While Pegasus had been doing his utmost to
shake Bellerophon off his back, he had flown
a very long distance; and they had come within
sight of a lofty mountain by the time the bit was
in his mouth. Bellerophon had seen this mountain
before, and knew it to be Helicon, on the summit
of which was the winged horse’s abode. Thither
(after looking gently into the rider’s face, as if to
ask leave) Pegasus now flew, and, alighting, waited
patiently until Bellerophon should please to dismount.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
The young man, accordingly, leaped from
his steed’s back, but still held him fast by the bridle.
Meeting his eyes, however, he was so affected by
the gentleness of his aspect, and by the thought of
the free life which Pegasus had heretofore lived,
that he could not bear to keep him a prisoner, if
he really desired his liberty.</p>

<p>Obeying this generous impulse he slipped the
enchanted bridle off the head of Pegasus, and took
the bit from his mouth.</p>

<p>“Leave me, Pegasus!” said he. “Either leave
me, or love me.”</p>

<p>In an instant the winged horse shot almost out
of sight, soaring straight upward from the summit
of Mount Helicon. Being long after sunset, it was
now twilight on the mountain-top, and dusky evening
over all the country round about. But Pegasus
flew so high that he overtook the departed day, and
was bathed in the upper radiance of the sun.
Ascending higher and higher, he looked a bright
speck, and, at last, could no longer be seen in the
hollow waste of the sky. And Bellerophon was
afraid that he should never behold him more. But,
while he was lamenting his own folly, the bright
speck reappeared, and drew nearer and nearer, until
it descended lower than the sunshine; and, behold,
Pegasus had come back! After this trial there
was no more fear of the winged horse’s making his
escape. He and Bellerophon were friends, and put
loving faith in one another.</p>

<p>That night they lay down and slept together,
with Bellerophon’s arm about the neck of Pegasus,
not as a caution, but for kindness. And they awoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
at peep of day, and bade one another good morning,
each in his own language.</p>

<p>In this manner, Bellerophon and the wondrous
steed spent several days, and grew better acquainted
and fonder of each other all the time.
They went on long aërial journeys, and sometimes
ascended so high that the earth looked hardly bigger
than—the moon. They visited distant countries,
and amazed the inhabitants, who thought that the
beautiful young man, on the back of the winged
horse, must have come down out of the sky. A
thousand miles a day was no more than an easy
space for the fleet Pegasus to pass over. Bellerophon
was delighted with this kind of life, and
would have liked nothing better than to live always
in the same way, aloft in the clear atmosphere; for
it was always sunny weather up there, however
cheerless and rainy it might be in the lower region.
But he could not forget the horrible Chimæra,
which he had promised King Iobates to slay. So,
at last, when he had become well accustomed to
feats of horsemanship in the air, and could manage
Pegasus with the least motion of his hand, and had
taught him to obey his voice, he determined to
attempt the performance of this perilous adventure.</p>

<p>At daybreak, therefore, as soon as he unclosed
his eyes, he gently pinched the winged horse’s ear,
in order to arouse him. Pegasus immediately
started from the ground, and pranced about a quarter
of a mile aloft, and made a grand sweep around
the mountain-top, by way of showing that he was
wide awake, and ready for any kind of an excursion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
During the whole of this little flight, he uttered a
loud, brisk, and melodious neigh, and finally came
down at Bellerophon’s side, as lightly as ever you
saw a sparrow hop upon a twig.</p>

<p>“Well done, dear Pegasus! well done, my sky-skimmer!”
cried Bellerophon, fondly stroking the
horse’s neck. “And now, my fleet and beautiful
friend, we must break our fast. To-day we are
to fight the terrible Chimæra.”</p>

<p>As soon as they had eaten their morning meal,
and drank some sparkling water from a spring
called Hippocrene, Pegasus held out his head, of
his own accord, so that his master might put on the
bridle. Then with a great many playful leaps and
airy caperings, he showed his impatience to be
gone; while Bellerophon was girding on his sword,
and hanging his shield about his neck, and preparing
himself for battle. When everything was
ready, the rider mounted, and (as was his custom,
when going a long distance) ascended five miles
perpendicularly, so as the better to see whither he
was directing his course. He then turned the head
of Pegasus toward the east, and set out for Lycia.
In their flight they overtook an eagle, and came
so nigh him, before he could get out of their way,
that Bellerophon might easily have caught him by
the leg. Hastening onward at this rate, it was still
early in the forenoon when they beheld the lofty
mountains of Lycia, with their deep and shaggy
valleys. If Bellerophon had been told truly, it was
in one of those dismal valleys that the hideous
Chimæra had taken up its abode.</p>

<p>Being now so near their journey’s end, the winged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
horse gradually descended with his rider; and they
took advantage of some clouds that were floating
over the mountain-tops, in order to conceal themselves.
Hovering on the upper surface of a cloud,
and peeping over its edge, Bellerophon had a
pretty distinct view of the mountainous part of
Lycia, and could look into all its shadowy vales at
once. At first there appeared to be nothing remarkable.
It was a wild, savage, and rocky tract of high
and precipitous hills. In the more level part of the
country, there were the ruins of houses that had
been burned, and, here and there, the carcasses of
dead cattle, strewn about the pastures where they
had been feeding.</p>

<p>“The Chimæra must have done this mischief,”
thought Bellerophon. “But where can the monster
be?”</p>

<p>As I have already said, there was nothing remarkable
to be detected, at first sight, in any of the valleys
and dells that lay among the precipitous heights
of the mountains. Nothing at all; unless, indeed, it
were three spires of black smoke, which issued from
what seemed to be the mouth of a cavern, and clambered
sullenly into the atmosphere. Before reaching
the mountain-top, these three black smoke-wreaths
mingled themselves into one. The cavern
was almost directly beneath the winged horse and
his rider, at the distance of about a thousand feet.
The smoke, as it crept heavily upward, had an ugly,
sulphurous, stifling scent, which caused Pegasus to
snort and Bellerophon to sneeze. So disagreeable
was it to the marvellous steed (who was accustomed
to breathe only the purest air), that he waved his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
wings, and shot half a mile out of the range of this
offensive vapor.</p>

<p>But, on looking behind him, Bellerophon saw
something that induced him first to draw the bridle,
and then to turn Pegasus about. He made a sign,
which the winged horse understood, and sunk slowly
through the air, until his hoofs were scarcely more
than a man’s height above the rocky bottom of the
valley. In front, as far off as you could throw a
stone, was the cavern’s mouth, with the three smoke-wreaths
oozing out of it. And what else did Bellerophon
behold there?</p>

<p>There seemed to be a heap of strange and terrible
creatures curled up within the cavern. Their bodies
lay so close together, that Bellerophon could not
distinguish them apart; but, judging by their heads,
one of these creatures was a huge snake, the second
a fierce lion, and the third an ugly goat. The lion
and the goat were asleep; the snake was broad
awake, and kept staring around him with a great
pair of fiery eyes. But—and this was the most wonderful
part of the matter—the three spires of smoke
evidently issued from the nostrils of these three
heads! So strange was the spectacle, that, though
Bellerophon had been all along expecting it, the
truth did not immediately occur to him, that here
was the terrible three-headed Chimæra. He had
found out the Chimæra’s cavern. The snake, the
lion, and the goat, as he supposed them to be, were
not three separate creatures, but one monster!</p>

<p>The wicked, hateful thing! Slumbering as two-thirds
of it were, it still held, in its abominable claws,
the remnant of an unfortunate lamb—or possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
(but I hate to think so) it was a dear little boy—which
its three mouths had been gnawing, before
two of them fell asleep!</p>

<p>All at once, Bellerophon started as from a
dream, and knew it to be the Chimæra. Pegasus
seemed to know it, at the same instant, and sent
forth a neigh, that sounded like the call of a trumpet
to battle. At this sound the three heads reared
themselves erect, and belched out great flashes of
flame. Before Bellerophon had time to consider
what to do next, the monster flung itself out of the
cavern and sprang straight toward him, with its immense
claws extended, and its snaky tail twisting
itself venomously behind. If Pegasus had not
been as nimble as a bird, both he and his rider
would have been overthrown by the Chimæra’s
headlong rush, and thus the battle have been ended
before it was well begun. But the winged horse
was not to be caught so. In the twinkling of an
eye he was up and aloft, half-way to the clouds,
snorting with anger. He shuddered, too, not with
affright, but with utter disgust at the loathsomeness
of this poisonous thing with three heads.</p>

<p>The Chimæra, on the other hand, raised itself
up so as to stand absolutely on the tip-end of its
tail, with its talons pawing fiercely in the air, and
its three heads spluttering fire at Pegasus and his
rider. My stars, how it roared, and hissed and
bellowed! Bellerophon, meanwhile, was fitting his
shield on his arm, and drawing his sword.</p>

<p>“Now, my beloved Pegasus,” he whispered in
the winged horse’s ear, “thou must help me to slay
this insufferable monster; or else thou shalt fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
back to thy solitary mountain-peak without thy
friend Bellerophon. For either the Chimæra dies,
or its three mouths shall gnaw this head of mine,
which has slumbered upon thy neck!”</p>

<p>Pegasus whinnied, and, turning back his head,
rubbed his nose tenderly against his rider’s cheek.
It was his way of telling him that, though he
had wings and was an immortal horse, yet
he would perish, if it were possible for immortality
to perish, rather than leave Bellerophon
behind.</p>

<p>“I thank you, Pegasus,” answered Bellerophon.
“Now, then, let us make a dash at the monster!”</p>

<p>Uttering these words, he shook the bridle; and
Pegasus darted down aslant, as swift as the flight
of an arrow, right toward the Chimæra’s threefold
head, which, all this time, was poking itself as high
as it could into the air. As he came within arm’s-length,
Bellerophon made a cut at the monster,
but was carried onward by his steed, before he
could see whether the blow had been successful.
Pegasus continued his course, but soon wheeled
round, at about the same distance from the
Chimæra as before. Bellerophon then perceived
that he had cut the goat’s head of the monster almost
off, so that it dangled downward by the skin,
and seemed quite dead.</p>

<p>But, to make amends, the snake’s head and the
lion’s head had taken all the fierceness of the dead
one into themselves, and spit flame, and hissed,
and roared, with a vast deal more fury than before.</p>

<p>“Never mind, my brave Pegasus!” cried Bellerophon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
“With another stroke like that, we will
stop either its hissing or its roaring.”</p>

<p>And again he shook the bridle. Dashing aslantwise,
as before, the winged horse made another
arrow-flight toward the Chimæra, and Bellerophon
aimed another downright stroke at one of the two
remaining heads, as he shot by. But this time,
neither he nor Pegasus escaped so well as at first.
With one of its claws, the Chimæra had given the
young man a deep scratch in his shoulder, and had
slightly damaged the left wing of the flying steed
with the other. On his part, Bellerophon had
mortally wounded the lion’s head of the monster,
insomuch that it now hung downward, with its fire
almost extinguished, and sending out gasps of
thick black smoke. The snake’s head, however
(which was the only one now left), was twice as
fierce and venomous as ever before. It belched
forth shoots of fire five hundred yards long, and
emitted hisses so loud, so harsh, and so ear-piercing,
that King Iobates heard them, fifty miles off,
and trembled till the throne shook under him.</p>

<p>“Well-a-day!” thought the poor king; “the Chimæra
is certainly coming to devour me!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pegasus had again paused in the air,
and neighed angrily, while sparkles of a pure
crystal flame darted out of his eyes. How unlike
the lurid fire of the Chimæra! The aërial steed’s
spirit was all aroused, and so was that of Bellerophon.</p>

<p>“Dost thou bleed, my immortal horse?” cried
the young man, caring less for his own hurt than
for the anguish of this glorious creature, that ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
never to have tasted pain. “The execrable Chimæra
shall pay for this mischief with his last head!”</p>

<p>Then he shook the bridle, shouted loudly, and
guided Pegasus, not aslantwise as before, but
straight at the monster’s hideous front. So rapid
was the onset, that it seemed but a dazzle and a
flash before Bellerophon was at close gripes with
his enemy.</p>

<p>The Chimæra, by this time, after losing its second
head, had got into a red-hot passion of pain
and rampant rage. It so flounced about, half on
earth and partly in the air, that it was impossible
to say which element it rested upon. It opened
its snake-jaws to such an abominable width, that
Pegasus might almost, I was going to say, have
flown right down its throat, wings outspread, rider
and all! At their approach it shot out a tremendous
blast of its fiery breath, and enveloped Bellerophon
and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of
flame, singeing the wings of Pegasus, scorching
off one whole side of the young man’s golden ringlets,
and making them both far hotter than was
comfortable, from head to foot.</p>

<p>But this was nothing to what followed.</p>

<p>When the airy rush of the winged horse had
brought him within the distance of one hundred
yards, the Chimæra gave a spring, and flung its
huge, awkward, venomous, and utterly detestable
carcass right upon poor Pegasus, clung around
him with might and main, and tied up its snaky
tail into a knot! Up flew the aërial steed, higher,
higher, higher, above the mountain-peaks, above
the clouds, and almost out of sight of the solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
earth. But still the earth-born monster kept its
hold, and was borne upward, along with the creature
of light and air. Bellerophon, meanwhile,
turning about, found himself face to face with the
ugly grimness of the Chimæra’s visage, and could
only avoid being scorched to death, or bitten right
in twain, by holding up his shield. Over the upper
edge of the shield, he looked sternly into the savage
eyes of the monster.</p>

<p>But the Chimæra was so mad and wild with pain,
that it did not guard itself so well as might else
have been the case. Perhaps, after all, the best
way to fight a Chimæra is by getting as close to it
as you can. In its efforts to stick its horrible iron
claws into its enemy, the creature left its own
breast quite exposed; and perceiving this, Bellerophon
thrust his sword up to the hilt into its cruel
heart. Immediately the snaky tail untied its knot.
The monster let go its hold of Pegasus, and fell
from that vast height downward; while the fire
within its bosom, instead of being put out, burned
fiercer than ever, and quickly began to consume the
dead carcass. Thus it fell out of the sky, all
aflame, and (it being nightfall before it reached
the earth) was mistaken for a shooting star or a
comet. But, at early sunrise, some cottagers were
going to their day’s labor, and saw, to their astonishment,
that several acres of ground were strewn
with black ashes. In the middle of a field, there
was a heap of whitened bones, a great deal higher
than a haystack. Nothing else was ever seen of
the dreadful Chimæra!</p>

<p>And when Bellerophon had won the victory, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
bent forward and kissed Pegasus, while the tears
stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Back now, my beloved steed!” said he. “Back
to the Fountain of Pirene!”</p>

<p>Pegasus skimmed through the air, quicker than
ever he did before, and reached the fountain in a
very short time. And there he found the old man
leaning on his staff, and the country fellow watering
his cow, and the pretty maiden filling her
pitcher.</p>

<p>“I remember now,” quoth the old man, “I saw
this winged horse once before, when I was quite
a lad. But he was ten times handsomer in those
days.”</p>

<p>“I own a cart-horse, worth three of him!” said
the country fellow. “If this pony were mine, the
first thing I should do would be to clip his wings!”</p>

<p>But the poor maiden said nothing, for she had
always the luck to be afraid at the wrong time.
So she ran away, and let her pitcher tumble down,
and broke it.</p>

<p>“Where is the gentle child,” asked Bellerophon,
“who used to keep me company, and never lost
his faith, and never was weary of gazing into the
fountain?”</p>

<p>“Here am I, dear Bellerophon!” said the child,
softly.</p>

<p>For the little boy had spent day after day, on
the margin of Pirene, waiting for his friend to
come back; but when he perceived Bellerophon descending
through the clouds, mounted on the
winged horse, he had shrunk back into the shrubbery.
He was a delicate and tender child, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
dreaded lest the old man and the country fellow
should see the tears gushing from his eyes.</p>

<p>“Thou hast won the victory,” said he, joyfully,
running to the knee of Bellerophon, who still sat
on the back of Pegasus. “I knew thou wouldst.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear child!” replied Bellerophon, alighting
from the winged horse. “But if thy faith had
not helped me, I should never have waited for
Pegasus, and never have gone up above the clouds,
and never have conquered the terrible Chimæra.
Thou, my beloved little friend, hast done it all.
And now let us give Pegasus his liberty.”</p>

<p>So he slipped off the enchanted bridle from the
head of the marvellous steed.</p>

<p>“Be free, for evermore, my Pegasus!” cried he,
with a shade of sadness in his tone. “Be as free as
thou art fleet!”</p>

<p>But Pegasus rested his head on Bellerophon’s
shoulder, and would not be persuaded to take
flight.</p>

<p>“Well then,” said Bellerophon, caressing the
airy horse, “thou shalt be with me, as long as thou
wilt; and we will go together, forthwith, and tell
King Iobates that the Chimæra is destroyed.”</p>

<p>Then Bellerophon embraced the gentle child,
and promised to come to him again, and departed.
But, in after years, that child took higher flights
upon the aërial steed than ever did Bellerophon,
and achieved more honorable deeds than his
friend’s victory over the Chimæra. For, gentle
and tender as he was, he grew to be a mighty poet!</p>

<h3 id="THE_HEROES_SAIL_AWAY_IN_SEARCH">THE HEROES SAIL AWAY IN SEARCH
OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE</h3>

<p class="author">By Charles Kingsley</p>

<p class="dropcap">This is a tale of heroes who sailed away into a
distant land to win themselves renown forever,
in the adventure of the Golden Fleece.
Whither they sailed, my children, I cannot clearly
tell. It all happened long ago; so long that it has
all grown dim, like a dream which you dreamed
last year. And why they went I cannot tell: some
say that it was to win gold. It may be so; but the
noblest deeds which have been done on earth have
not been done for gold.</p>

<p>The Spartans looked for no reward in money
when they fought and died at Thermopylæ; and
Socrates the wise asked no pay from his countrymen,
but lived poor and barefoot all his days, only
caring to make men good. And there are heroes
in our days also, who do noble deeds, but not for
gold. Our discoverers did not go to make themselves
rich when they sailed out one after another
into the dreary frozen seas.</p>

<p>Therefore we will believe—why should we not?—of
these same Argonauts of old, that they too
were noble men, who planned and did a noble deed;
and that therefore their fame has lived, and been
told in story and in song, mixed up, no doubt, with
dreams and fables, and yet true and right at heart.
So we will honor these old Argonauts, and listen
to their story as it stands; and we will try to be like
them, each of us in our place; for each of us has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a Golden Fleece to seek, and a wild sea to sail over
ere we reach it, and dragons to fight ere it be ours.</p>

<p>And what was that first Golden Fleece? I do
not know, nor care. The old Greeks said that it
hung in Colchis, which we call the Circassian coast,
nailed to a beech-tree in the War-god’s wood; and
that it was the fleece of the wondrous ram who bore
Phrixus and Helle across the Black Sea. For
Phrixus and Helle were the children of the cloud-nymph,
and of Athamas the Minuan king. And
when a famine came upon the land, their cruel
stepmother Ino wished to kill them, that her own
children might reign, and said that they must be
sacrificed on an altar, to turn away the anger of the
gods. So the poor children were brought to the
altar, and the priest stood ready with his knife, when
out of the clouds came the Golden Ram, and took
them on his back, and vanished. Then madness
came upon that foolish king, Athamas, and ruin
upon Ino and her children. For Athamas killed one
of them in his fury; and Ino fled from him with
the other in her arms, and leaped from a cliff into
the sea, and was changed into a dolphin, such as you
have seen, which wanders over the waves forever
sighing, with its little one clasped to its breast.</p>

<p>But the people drove out King Athamas, because
he had killed his child; and he roamed about
in his misery, till he came to the Oracle in Delphi.
And the Oracle told him that he must wander for
his sin, till the wild beasts should feast him as their
guest. So he went on in hunger and sorrow for
many a weary day, till he saw a pack of wolves.
The wolves were tearing a sheep; but when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
saw Athamas they fled, and left the sheep for him,
and he ate of it; and then he knew that the oracle
was fulfilled at last. So he wandered no more;
but settled, and built a town, and became a king
again.</p>

<p>But the ram carried the two children far away
over land and sea, till he came to the Thracian
Chersonese, and there Helle fell into the sea. So
those narrow straits are called “Hellespont,” after
her; and they bear that name until this day.</p>

<p>Then the ram flew on with Phrixus to the north-east
across the sea which we call the Black Sea
now; but the Greeks call it Euxine. And at last,
they say, he stopped at Colchis, on the steep Circassian
coast; and there Phrixus married Chaleiope,
the daughter of Aietes the king; and offered
the ram in sacrifice; and Aietes nailed the ram’s
fleece to a beech, in the grove of Mars the War-god.</p>

<p>After a while Phrixus died, and was buried, but
his spirit had no rest; for he was buried far from
his native land, and the pleasant hills of Greece.
So he came in dreams to the heroes of the Minuai,
and called sadly by their beds, “Come and set my
spirit free, that I may go home to my fathers and
to my kinsfolk, and the pleasant Minuan land.”</p>

<p>And they asked, “How shall we set your spirit
free?”</p>

<p>“You must sail over the sea to Colchis, and bring
home the Golden Fleece; and then my spirit will
come back with it, and I shall sleep with my
fathers and have rest.”</p>

<p class="caption"><i>From the painting by T. H. Robinson</i></p>

</div>

<p>Often he came thus, and called to them, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
they awoke they looked at each other, and said,
“Who dare sail to Colchis, or bring home the
Golden Fleece?” And in all the country none was
brave enough to try it; for the man and the time
were not come.</p>

<p>Phrixus had a cousin called Æson, who was king
in Iolcos by the sea. There he ruled over the rich
Minuan heroes, as Athamas his uncle ruled in
Bœotia; and, like Athamas, he was an unhappy
man. For he had a stepbrother named Pelias, of
whom some said that he was a nymph’s son, and
there were dark and sad tales about his birth.
When he was a babe he was cast out on the
mountains, and a wild mare came by and kicked
him. But a shepherd passing found the baby, with
its face all blackened by the blow; and took him
home, and called him Pelias, because his face was
bruised and black. And he grew up fierce and
lawless, and did many a fearful deed; and at last
he drove out Æson his stepbrother, and then his
own brother Neleus, and took the kingdom to himself,
and ruled over the rich Minuan heroes, in
Iolcos by the sea.</p>

<p>And Æson, when he was driven out, went sadly
away out of the town, leading his little son by the
hand; and he said to himself, “I must hide the
child in the mountains; or Pelias will surely kill
him, because he is the heir.”</p>

<p>So he went up from the sea across the valley,
through the vineyards and the olive groves, and
across the torrent of Anauros, toward Pelion, the
ancient mountain, whose brows are white with
snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>He went up and up into the mountain, over
marsh, and crag, and down, till the boy was tired
and footsore, and Æson had to bear him in his
arms, till he came to the mouth of a lonely cave, at
the foot of a mighty cliff.</p>

<p>Above the cliff the snow-wreaths hung, dripping
and cracking in the sun; but at its foot around the
cave’s mouth grew all fair flowers and herbs, as if
in a garden, ranged in order, each sort by itself.
There they grew gaily in the sunshine, and the
spray of the torrent from above; while from the
cave came the sound of music, and a man’s voice
singing to the harp.</p>

<p>Then Æson put down the lad, and whispered:
“Fear not, but go in, and whomsoever you shall
find, lay your hands upon his knees and say, ‘In the
name of Jupiter, the father of gods and men, I
am your guest from this day forth.’”</p>

<p>Then the lad went in without trembling, for he
too was a hero’s son; but when he was within, he
stopped in wonder to listen to that magic song.</p>

<p>And there he saw the singer lying upon bear-skins
and fragrant boughs: Chiron, the ancient
Centaur, the wisest of all things beneath the sky.
Down to the waist he was a man, but below he was
a noble horse; his white hair rolled down over his
broad shoulders, and his white beard over his broad
brown chest; and his eyes were wise and mild, and
his forehead like a mountain wall.</p>

<p>And in his hands he held a harp of gold, and
struck it with a golden key; and as he struck, he
sang till his eyes glittered, and filled all the cave
with light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>And he sang of the birth of Time, and of the
heavens and the dancing stars; of the ocean, and
the ether, and the fire, and the shaping of the
wondrous earth. And he sang of the treasures of
the hills, and the hidden jewels of the mine, and
the veins of fire and metal, and the virtues of all
healing herbs, and of the speech of birds, and of
prophecy, and of hidden things to come.</p>

<p>Then he sang of health, and strength, and manhood,
and a valiant heart; and of music, and hunting,
and wrestling, and all the games which heroes
love; and of travel, and wars, and sieges, and a
noble death in fight; and then he sang of peace and
plenty, and of equal justice in the land; and as he
sang the boy listened wide-eyed, and forgot his
errand in the song.</p>

<p>And at the last old Chiron was silent, and called
the lad with a soft voice. And the lad ran trembling
to him, and would have laid his hands upon
his knees; but Chiron smiled, and said, “Call hither
your father Æson, for I know you, and all that has
befallen, and saw you both afar in the valley, even
before you left the town.”</p>

<p>Then Æson came in sadly, and Chiron asked
him, “Why camest you not yourself to me, Æson
the Æolid?”</p>

<p>And Æson said: “I thought, Chiron will pity the
lad if he sees him come alone; and I wished to try
whether he was fearless, and dare venture like a
hero’s son. But now I entreat you by Father Jupiter,
let the boy be your guest till better times, and
train him among the sons of the heroes, that he may
avenge his father’s house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Chiron smiled, and drew the lad to him,
and laid his hand upon his golden locks, and said,
“Are you afraid of my horse’s hoofs, fair boy, or
will you be my pupil from this day?”</p>

<p>“I would gladly have horse’s hoofs like you, if
I could sing such songs as yours.”</p>

<p>And Chiron laughed, and said, “Sit here by me
till sundown, when your playfellows will come
home, and you shall learn like them to be a king,
worthy to rule over gallant men.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to Æson, and said, “Go back in
peace, and bend before the storm like a prudent
man. This boy shall not cross the Anauros again,
till he has become a glory to you and to the house
of Æolus.”</p>

<p>And Æson wept over his son and went away;
but the boy did not weep, so full was his fancy of
that strange cave, and the Centaur, and his song,
and the playfellows whom he was to see.</p>

<p>Then Chiron put the lyre into his hands, and
taught him how to play it, till the sun sank low
behind the cliff, and a shout was heard outside.</p>

<p>And then in came the sons of the heroes, Æneas,
and Hercules, and Peleus, and many another
mighty name. And great Chiron leaped up joyfully,
and his hoofs made the cave resound, as they
shouted, “Come out, Father Chiron; come out and
see our game.” And one cried, “I have killed two
deer”; and another, “I took a wildcat among the
crags”; and Hercules dragged a wild goat after
him by its horns, for he was as huge as a mountain
crag; and Cœneus carried a bear-cub under each
arm, and laughed when they scratched and bit, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
neither tooth nor steel could wound him. And
Chiron praised them all, each according to his
deserts.</p>

<p>Only one walked apart and silent, Æsculapius,
the too-wise child, carrying herbs and flowers, and
round his wrist a spotted snake; he came with
downcast eyes to Chiron, and whispered how he
had watched the snake cast its old skin, and grow
young again before his eyes, and how he had gone
down into a village in the vale, and cured a dying
man with a herb which he had seen a sick goat eat.</p>

<p>And Chiron smiled, and said, “To each Minerva
and Apollo gave some gift, and each is worthy
in his place; but to this child they have given an
honor beyond all honors, to cure while others kill.”</p>

<p>Then the lads brought in wood and split it, and
lighted a blazing fire; and others skinned the deer
and quartered them, and set them to roast before
the fire; and while the venison was cooking they
bathed in the snow torrent, and washed away the
dust and sweat.</p>

<p>And then all ate till they could eat no more (for
they had tasted nothing since the dawn), and drank
of the clear spring water. And when the remnants
were put away, they all lay down upon the skins
and leaves about the fire, and each took the lyre in
turn, and sang and played with all his heart.</p>

<p>After a while they all went out to a plot of grass
at the cave’s mouth, and there they boxed, and
ran, and wrestled, and laughed till the stones fell
from the cliffs.</p>

<p>Then Chiron took his lyre, and all the lads joined
hands; and as he played, they danced to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
measure, in and out, and round and round. There
they danced hand in hand, till the night fell over
land and sea, while the black glen shone with their
broad white limbs and the gleam of their golden
hair.</p>

<p>And the lad danced with them, delighted, and
then slept a wholesome sleep, upon fragrant leaves
of bay, and myrtle, and marjoram, and flowers of
thyme; and rose at the dawn, and bathed in the
torrent, and became a school-fellow to the heroes’
sons, and forgot Iolcos, and his father, and all his
former life. But he grew strong, and brave, and
cunning, upon the pleasant downs of Pelion, in
the keen hungry mountain air. And he learned to
wrestle, and to box, and to hunt, and to play upon
the harp; and next he learned to ride, for old
Chiron used to mount him on his back; and he
learned the virtues of all herbs, and how to cure all
wounds; and Chiron called him Jason the healer,
and that is his name until this day.</p>

<h3 id="HOW_JASON_LOST_HIS_SANDAL">HOW JASON LOST HIS SANDAL</h3>

<p class="author">By Charles Kingsley</p>

<p class="dropcap">Ten years came and went, and Jason was
grown to be a mighty man. Some of his fellows
were gone, and some were growing up by his
side. Æsculapius was gone into Peloponnesus to
work his wondrous cures on men; and some say he
used to raise the dead to life. And Hercules was
gone to Thebes to fulfil those famous labors which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
have become a proverb among men. Peleus had
married a sea-nymph, and his wedding is famous to
this day. And Æneas was gone home to Troy, and
many a noble tale you will read of him, and of all
the other gallant heroes, the scholars of Chiron the
just.</p>

<p>Now it happened on a day that Jason stood on
the mountain, and looked north and south and east
and west; and Chiron stood by him and watched
him, for he knew that the time was come. And
Jason looked and saw the plains of Thessaly, where
the Lapithæ breed their horses; and the lake of
Boibé, and the stream which runs northward to
Peneus and Tempe; and he looked north, and saw
the mountain wall which guards the Magnesian
shore; Olympus, the seat of the Immortals, and
Ossa, and Pelion, where he stood. Then he looked
east and saw the bright blue sea, which stretched
away forever toward the dawn. Then he looked
south, and saw a pleasant land, with white-walled
towns and farms, nestling along the shore of a land-locked
bay, while the smoke rose blue among the
trees; and he knew it for the bay of Pagasai, and
the rich lowlands of Hæmonia, and Iolcos by the
sea.</p>

<p>Then he sighed, and asked, “Is it true what
the heroes tell me—that I am heir of that fair
land?”</p>

<p>“And what good would it be to you, Jason, if
you were heir of that fair land?”</p>

<p>“I would take it and keep it.”</p>

<p>“A strong man has taken it and kept it long.
Are you stronger than Pelias the terrible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can try my strength with his,” said Jason; but
Chiron sighed, and said:</p>

<p>“You have many a danger to go through before
you rule in Iolcos by the sea: many a danger and
many a woe; and strange troubles in strange lands,
such as man never saw before.”</p>

<p>“The happier I,” said Jason, “to see what man
never saw before.”</p>

<p>And Chiron sighed again, and said, “The eaglet
must leave the nest when it is fledged. Will you go
to Iolcos by the sea? Then promise me two things
before you go.” Jason promised, and Chiron answered,
“Speak harshly to no soul whom you may
meet, and stand by the word which you shall speak.”</p>

<p>Jason wondered why Chiron asked this of him;
but he knew that the Centaur was a prophet, and
saw things long before they came. So he promised,
and leaped down the mountain, to take his fortune
like a man. He went down through the arbutus
thickets, and across the downs of thyme, till he
came to the vineyard walls, and the pomegranates
and the olives in the glen; and among the olives
roared Anauros, all foaming with a summer flood.</p>

<p>And on the bank of Anauros sat a woman, all
wrinkled, gray, and old, her head shook palsied on
her breast, and her hands shook palsied on her
knees; and when she saw Jason, she spoke whining,
“Who will carry me across the flood?”</p>

<p>Jason was bold and hasty, and was just going to
leap into the flood: and yet he thought twice before
he leaped, so loud roared the torrent down, all
brown from the mountain rains, and silver-veined
with melting snow; while underneath he could hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the bowlders rumbling like the tramp of horsemen
or the roll of wheels, as they ground along the narrow
channel, and shook the rocks on which he stood.</p>

<p>But the old woman whined all the more, “I am
weak and old, fair youth. For Juno’s sake, carry
me over the torrent.”</p>

<p>And Jason was going to answer her scornfully,
when Chiron’s words came to his mind. So he said,
“For Juno’s sake, the Queen of the Immortals on
Olympus, I will carry you over the torrent, unless
we both are drowned midway.”</p>

<p>Then the old dame leaped upon his back, as
nimbly as a goat; and Jason staggered in, wondering;
and the first step was up to his knees. The
first step was up to his knees, and the second step
was up to his waist; and the stones rolled about his
feet, and his feet slipped about the stones; so he
went on staggering and panting, while the old
woman cried from off his back: “Fool, you have
wet my mantle! Do you make game of poor old
souls like me?”</p>

<p>Jason had half a mind to drop her, and let her get
through the torrent by herself; but Chiron’s words
were in his mind, and he said only, “Patience,
mother; the best horse may stumble some day.”</p>

<p>At last he staggered to the shore, and set her
down upon the bank; and a strong man he needed
to have been or that wild water he never would
have crossed.</p>

<p>He lay panting awhile upon the bank, and then
leaped up to go upon his journey; but he cast one
look at the old woman, for he thought, “She should
thank me once at least.” And as he looked, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
grew fairer than all women, and taller than all men
on earth; and her garments shone like the summer
sea, and her jewels like the stars of heaven; and
over her forehead was a veil, woven of the golden
clouds of sunset; and through the veil she looked
down on him, with great soft heifer’s eyes; with
great eyes, mild and awful, which filled all the glen
with light. And Jason fell upon his knees, and hid
his face between his hands.</p>

<p>And she spoke, “I am the Queen of Olympus,
Juno the wife of Jupiter. As thou hast done to
me, so will I do to thee. Call on me in the hour of
need, and try if the Immortals can forget.”</p>

<p>And when Jason looked up, she rose from off the
earth, like a pillar of tall white cloud, and floated
away across the mountain peaks toward Olympus,
the holy hill.</p>

<p>Then a great fear fell on Jason: but after a while
he grew light of heart; and he blessed old Chiron,
and said, “Surely the Centaur is a prophet, and
guessed what would come to pass, when he bade me
speak harshly to no soul whom I might meet.”</p>

<p>Then he went down toward Iolcos; and as he
walked he found that he had lost one of his sandals
in the flood. And as he went through the streets,
the people came out to look at him, so tall and fair
was he; but some of the elders whispered together;
and at last one of them stopped Jason, and called
to him, “Fair lad, who are you, and whence come
you; and what is your errand in the town?”</p>

<p>“My name, good father, is Jason, and I come
from Pelion up above; and my errand is to Pelias
your king; tell me then where his palace is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old man started, and grew pale, and said,
“Do you not know the oracle, my son, that you go
so boldly through the town with but one sandal on?”</p>

<p>“I am a stranger here and know of no oracle;
but what of my one sandal? I lost the other in
Anauros, while I was struggling with the flood.”</p>

<p>Then the old man looked back to his companions:
and one sighed, and another smiled; at last he said,
“I will tell you, lest you rush upon your ruin unawares.
The oracle in Delphi has said that a man
wearing one sandal should take the kingdom from
Pelias, and keep it for himself. Therefore beware
how you go up to his palace, for he is the fiercest
and most cunning of all kings.”</p>

<p>Then Jason laughed a great laugh, like a war-horse
in his pride. “Good news, good father, both
for you and me. For that very end I came into the
town.” Then he strode on toward the palace of
Pelias, while all the people wondered at his bearing.</p>

<p>And he stood in the doorway and cried, “Come
out, come out, Pelias the valiant, and fight for your
kingdom like a man.”</p>

<p>Pelias came out wondering, and “Who are you,
bold youth?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I am Jason, the son of Æson, the heir of all this
land.”</p>

<p>Then Pelias lifted up his hands and eyes, and
wept, or seemed to weep; and blessed the heavens
which had brought his nephew to him, never to leave
him more. “For,” said he, “I have but three daughters,
and no son to be my heir. You shall be my
heir then, and rule the kingdom after me, and marry
whichsoever of my daughters you shall choose;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
though a sad kingdom you will find it, and whosoever
rules it a miserable man. But come in, come
in, and feast.”</p>

<p>So he drew Jason in, whether he would or not,
and spoke to him so lovingly and feasted him so
well, that Jason’s anger passed; and after supper
his three cousins came into the hall, and Jason
thought that he should like well enough to have one
of them for his wife.</p>

<p>But at last he said to Pelias, “Why do you look
so sad, my uncle? And what did you mean just
now when you said that this was a doleful kingdom,
and its ruler a miserable man?”</p>

<p>Pelias sighed heavily again and again and again,
like a man who had to tell some dreadful story, and
was afraid to begin; but at last—“For seven long
years and more have I never known a quiet night;
and no more will he who comes after me, till the
Golden Fleece be brought home.” Then he told
Jason the story of Phrixus, and of the Golden
Fleece; and told him, too, which was a lie, that
Phrixus’ spirit tormented him, calling to him day
and night. And his daughters came, and told the
same tale (for their father had taught them their
parts), and wept, and said, “Oh who will bring
home the Golden Fleece, that our uncle’s spirit may
rest; and that we may have rest also, whom he never
lets sleep in peace?”</p>

<p>Jason sat awhile, sad and silent; for he had often
heard of that Golden Fleece; but he looked on it as
a thing hopeless and impossible for any mortal man
to win.</p>

<p>But when Pelias saw him silent, he began to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of other things, and courted Jason more and more,
speaking to him as if he was certain to be his heir,
and asking his advice about the kingdom; till Jason,
who was young and simple, could not help saying to
himself, “Surely he is not the dark man whom people
call him. Yet why did he drive my father out?”</p>

<p>And he asked Pelias boldly, “Men say that you
are terrible, and a man of blood; but I find you a
kind and hospitable man; and as you are to me, so
will I be to you. Yet why did you drive my father
out?”</p>

<p>Pelias smiled, and sighed. “Men have slandered
me in that, as in all things. Your father was growing
old and weary, and he gave the kingdom up to
me of his own will. You shall see him to-morrow,
and ask him; and he will tell you the same.”</p>

<p>Jason’s heart leaped in him when he heard that he
was to see his father; and he believed all that Pelias
said, forgetting that his father might not dare to
tell the truth.</p>

<p>“One thing more there is,” said Pelias, “on
which I need your advice; for, though you are
young, I see in you wisdom beyond your years.
There is one neighbor of mine, whom I dread more
than all men on earth. I am stronger than he now,
and can command him; but I know that if he stay
among us, he will work my ruin in the end. Can
you give me a plan, Jason, by which I can rid myself
of that man?”</p>

<p>After a while Jason answered, half laughing,
“Were I you, I would send him to fetch that same
Golden Fleece; for if he once set forth after it
you would never be troubled with him more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>A bitter smile came across Pelias’ lips, and a
flash of wicked joy into his eyes; and Jason saw it,
and started; and over his mind came the warning
of the old man, and his own one sandal, and the
oracle, and he saw that he was taken in a trap.
But Pelias only answered gently, “My son, he shall
be sent forthwith.”</p>

<p>“You mean me?” cried Jason, starting up,
“because I came here with one sandal?” And he
lifted his fist angrily, while Pelias stood up to him
like a wolf at bay; and whether of the two was the
stronger and the fiercer it would be hard to tell.</p>

<p>But after a moment Pelias spoke gently, “Why
then so rash, my son? You, and not I, have said
what is said; why blame me for what I have not
done? Had you bid me love the man of whom I
spoke, and make him my son-in-law and heir, I
would have obeyed you; and what if I obey you
now, and send the man to win himself immortal
fame? I have not harmed you, or him. One thing
at least I know, that he will go, and that gladly;
for he has a hero’s heart within him, loving glory,
and scorning to break the word which he has
given.”</p>

<p>Jason saw that he was entrapped; but his second
promise to Chiron came into his mind, and he
thought, “What if the Centaur were a prophet in
that also, and meant that I should win the fleece!”
Then he cried aloud: “You have well spoken, cunning
uncle of mine! I love glory, and I dare keep
to my word. I will go and fetch this Golden Fleece.
Promise me but this in return, and keep your word
as I keep mine. Treat my father lovingly while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
I am gone, for the sake of all-seeing Jupiter,
and give me up the kingdom for my own on the
day that I bring back the Golden Fleece.”</p>

<p>Then Pelias looked at him and almost loved him,
in the midst of all his hate; and said, “I promise,
and I will perform. It will be no shame to
give up my kingdom to the man who wins that
fleece.”</p>

<p>Then they swore a great oath between them,
and afterward both went in, and lay down to
sleep.</p>

<p>But Jason could not sleep for thinking of his
mighty oath, and how he was to fulfil it, all alone,
and without wealth or friends. So he tossed a long
time upon his bed, and thought of this plan and
of that; and sometimes Phrixus seemed to call him,
in a thin voice, faint and low, as if it came from far
across the sea, “Let me come home to my fathers
and have rest.” And sometimes he seemed to see
the eyes of Juno, and to hear her words again—“Call
on me in the hour of need, and see if the
Immortals can forget.”</p>

<p>And on the morrow he went to Pelias, and said,
“Give me a victim, that I may sacrifice to Juno.”
So he went up, and offered his sacrifice; and as he
stood by the altar Juno sent a thought into his
mind; and he went back to Pelias, and said:</p>

<p>“If you are indeed in earnest, give me two
heralds, that they may go round to all the princes
of the Minuai, who were pupils of the Centaur
with me, that we may fit out a ship together, and
take what shall befall.”</p>

<p>At that Pelias praised his wisdom, and hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to send the heralds out; for he said in his heart,
“Let all the princes go with him, and, like him,
never return; for so I shall be lord of all the
Minuai, and the greatest king in Greece.”</p>

<p class="author">By Charles Kingsley</p>

<p class="dropcap">So the heralds went out, and cried to all the
heroes of the Minuai, “Who dare come to the
adventure of the Golden Fleece?”</p>

<p>And Juno stirred the hearts of all the princes,
and they came from all their valleys to the yellow
sands of Pagasai. And first came Hercules, the
mighty, with his lion’s skin and club, and behind
him Hylas his young squire, who bore his arrows
and his bow; and Tiphys, the skilful steersman;
and Butes, the fairest of all men; and Castor and
Pollux the twins, the sons of the magic swan; and
Cæneus, the strongest of mortals; and thither came
Zetes and Calais, the winged sons of the North
Wind; and Peleus, the father of Achilles, whose
bride was silver-footed Thetis, the goddess of the
Sea. And thither came Telamon and Oileus, the
fathers of the two Aiantes, who fought upon the
plains of Troy; and Mopsus, the wise soothsayer,
who knew the speech of birds; and Idmon, to whom
Phœbus gave a tongue to prophesy of things to
come; and Ancaios, who could read the stars; and
Argus, the famed shipbuilder, and many a hero
more, in helmets of brass and gold with tall dyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
horsehair crests, and embroidered shirts of linen
beneath their coats of mail, and greaves of polished
tin to guard their knees in fight; with each man
his shield upon his shoulder, of many a fold of
tough bull’s hide, and his sword of tempered bronze
in his silver-studded belt; and in his right hand a
pair of lances, of the heavy white ash-staves.</p>

</div>

<p>So they came down to Iolcos, and all the city
came out to meet them, and were never tired with
looking at their height, and their beauty, and their
gallant bearing, and the glitter of their inlaid arms.
And some said, “Never was such a gathering of the
heroes since the Greeks conquered the land.” But
the women sighed over them, and whispered, “Alas!
they are all going to their death!”</p>

<p>Then they felled the pines on Pelion, and shaped
them with the axe, and Argus taught them to build
a galley, the first long ship which ever sailed the
seas. They pierced her for fifty oars—an oar for
each hero of the crew—and pitched her with coal-black
pitch, and painted her bows with vermilion;
and they named her <i>Argo</i> after Argus, and
worked at her all day long. And at night Pelias
feasted them like a king, and they slept in his
palace-porch.</p>

<p>But Jason went away to the northward, and into
the land of Thrace, till he found Orpheus, the
prince of minstrels, where he dwelt in his cave under
Rhodope, among the savage Cicon tribes. And
he asked him, “Will you leave your mountains,
Orpheus, my fellow-scholar in old times, and cross
Strymon once more with me, to sail with the heroes
of the Minuai, and bring home the Golden Fleece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and charm for us all men and all monsters with
your magic harp and song?”</p>

<p>Then Orpheus sighed, “Have I not had enough
of toil and of weary wandering far and wide since
I lived in Chiron’s cave, above Iolcos by the sea?
In vain is the skill and the voice which my goddess
mother gave me; in vain have I sung and labored;
in vain I went down to the dead, and charmed all
the kings of Hades, to win back Eurydice my bride.
For I won her, my beloved, and lost her again the
same day, and wandered away in my madness,
even to Egypt and the Libyan sands, and the isles
of all the seas, driven on by the terrible gadfly, while
I charmed in vain the hearts of men, and the savage
forest beasts, and the trees, and the lifeless stones,
with my magic harp and song, giving rest, but
finding none. But at last Calliope, my mother,
delivered me and brought me home in peace; and
I dwell here in the cave alone, among the savage
Cicon tribes, softening their wild hearts with music
and the gentle laws of Jupiter. And now I must
go out again to the ends of all the earth, far away
into the misty darkness, to the last wave of the
Eastern sea. But what is doomed must be, and a
friend’s demand obeyed; for prayers are the
daughters of Jupiter, and who honors them honors
him.”</p>

<p>Then Orpheus rose up sighing, and took his
harp, and went over Strymon. And he led Jason
to the southwest, up the banks of Haliacmon and
over the spurs of Pindus, to Dodona the town of
Jupiter, where it stood by the side of the sacred
lake, and the fountain which breathed out fire, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the darkness of the ancient oak-wood, beneath the
mountain of the hundred springs. And he led
them to the Talking Oak, where the black dove
settled in old times, and was changed into the
priestess of Jupiter, and gave oracles to all nations
round. And he bade him cut down a bough, and
sacrifice to Juno and to Jupiter, and they took
the bough and came to Iolcos, and nailed it to the
beakhead of the ship.</p>

<p>At last the ship was finished and they tried to
launch her down the beach; but she was too heavy
for them to move her, and her keel sank deep into
the sand. Then all the heroes looked at each other
blushing; but Jason spoke and said, “Let us ask
the magic bough; perhaps it can help us in our
need.”</p>

<p>Then a voice came from the bough, and Jason
heard the words it said, and bade Orpheus play
upon the harp, while the heroes waited round,
holding the pine-trunk rollers, to help her toward
the sea.</p>

<p>So Orpheus took his harp, and began his magic
song: “How sweet it is to ride upon the surges,
and to leap from wave to wave, while the wind
sings cheerful in the cordage, and the oars flash fast
among the foam! How sweet it is to roam across
the ocean, and see new towns and wondrous lands,
and to come home laden with treasure, and to win
undying fame!”</p>

<p>And the good ship <i>Argo</i> heard him, and longed
to be away and out at sea; till she stirred in every
timber, and heaved from stem to stern, and leaped
up from the sand upon the rollers, and plunged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
onward like a gallant horse; and the heroes fed her
path with pine-trunks, till she rushed into the
whispering sea.</p>

<p>Then they stored her well with food and water,
and pulled the ladder up on board, and settled
themselves each man to his oar, and kept time to
Orpheus’ harp; and away across the bay they
rowed southward, while the people lined the cliffs;
and the women wept, while the men shouted, at the
starting of that gallant crew.</p>

<h3 id="HOW_THE_ARGONAUTS_SAILED_TO">HOW THE ARGONAUTS SAILED TO
COLCHIS</h3>

<p class="author">By Charles Kingsley</p>

<p class="dropcap">What happened next, my children, whether
it be true or not, stands written in ancient
songs, which you shall read for yourselves some
day. And grand old songs they are, written in
grand old rolling verse; and they call them the
Songs of Orpheus, or the Orphics, to this day.
They tell how the heroes came to Aphetai, across
the bay, and waited for the southwest wind, and
chose themselves a captain from their crew: and
how all called for Hercules, because he was the
strongest and most huge; but Hercules refused,
and called for Jason, because he was the wisest of
them all. So Jason was chosen captain; and
Orpheus heaped a pile of wood, and slew a bull,
and offered it to Juno, and called all the heroes to
stand round, each man’s head crowned with olive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and to strike their swords into the bull. Then he
filled a golden goblet with the bull’s blood, and with
wheaten flour, and honey, and wine, and the bitter
salt-sea water, and bade the heroes taste. So each
tasted the goblet, and passed it round, and vowed
an awful vow: and they vowed before the sun, and
the night, and the blue-haired sea who shakes the
land, to stand by Jason faithfully in the adventure
of the Golden Fleece; and whosoever shrank back,
or disobeyed, or turned traitor to his vow, then
justice should minister against him, and the Fates
who track guilty men.</p>

<p>Then Jason lighted the pile, and burned the
carcass of the bull; and they went to their ship and
sailed eastward, like men who have a work to do;
and the place from which they went was called
Aphetai, the sailing-place from that day forth.
Three thousand years and more ago they sailed
away, into the unknown Eastern seas, and great
nations have come and gone since then, and many
a storm has swept the earth; many a mighty armament,
to which <i>Argo</i> would be but one small boat,
English and French, Turkish and Russian, have
sailed those waters since, yet the fame of that small
<i>Argo</i> lives forever, and her name is become a
proverb among men.</p>

<p>So they sailed past the Isle of Sciathos, with the
Cape of Sepius on their left, and turned to the
northward toward Pelion, up the long Magnesian
shore. On their right hand was the open sea, and
on their left old Pelion rose, while the clouds
crawled round his dark pine-forests, and his caps
of summer snow. And their hearts yearned for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the dear old mountain, as they thought of pleasant
days gone by, and of the sports of their boyhood,
their hunting, and their schooling in the cave
beneath the cliff. At last Peleus spoke, “Let us
land here, friends, and climb the dear old hill once
more. We are going on a fearful journey; who
knows if we shall see Pelion again? Let us go up
to Chiron our master, and ask his blessing ere we
start. And I have a boy, too, with him, whom he
trains as he trained me once—the son whom Thetis
brought me, the silver-footed lady of the sea, whom
I caught in the cave, and tamed her, though she
changed her shape seven times. For she changed,
as I held her, into water, and to vapor, and to burning
flame, and to a rock, and to a black-maned
lion, and to a tall and stately tree. But I held her
and held her ever, till she took her own shape again,
and led her to my father’s house, and won her
for my bride. And all the rulers of Olympus came
to our wedding, and the heavens and the earth
rejoiced together, when an Immortal wedded a
mortal man. And now let me see my son; for it
is not often I shall see him upon earth: famous he
will be, but short-lived, and die in the flower of
youth.”</p>

<p>So Tiphys the helmsman steered them to the
shore under the crag of Pelion; and they went up
through the dark pine-forests toward the Centaur’s
cave.</p>

<p>As they came into the misty hall, beneath the
snow-crowned crag, they saw the great Centaur
lying, with his huge limbs spread upon the rocks;
and beside him stood Achilles, the child whom no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
steel could wound, and played upon his harp right
sweetly, while Chiron watched and smiled.</p>

<p>Then Chiron leaped up and welcomed them, and
kissed them every one, and set a feast before them
of swine’s flesh, and venison, and good wine; and
young Achilles served them, and carried the golden
goblet round. And after supper all the heroes
clapped their hands, and called on Orpheus to sing;
but he refused, and said, “How can I, who am the
younger, sing before our ancient host?” So they
called on Chiron to sing, and Achilles brought him
his harp; and he began a wondrous song, a famous
story of old time, of the fight between the Centaurs
and the Lapithai, which you may still see carved
in stone. He sang how his brothers came to ruin
by their folly, when they were mad with wine;
and how they and the heroes fought, with fists, and
teeth, and the goblets from which they drank; and
how they tore up the pine-trees in their fury, and
hurled great crags of stone, while the mountains
thundered with the battle, and the land was wasted
far and wide; till the Lapithai drove them from
their home in the rich Thessalian plains to the
lonely glens of Pindus, leaving Chiron all alone.
And the heroes praised his song right heartily; for
some of them had helped in that great fight.</p>

<p>Then Orpheus took the lyre, and sang of Chaos,
and the making of the wondrous World, and how
all things sprang from Love, who could not live
alone in the Abyss. And as he sang, his voice rose
from the cave, above the crags, and through the
tree-tops, and the glens of oak and pine. And the
trees bowed their heads when they heard it, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
gray rocks cracked and rang, and the forest beasts
crept near to listen, and the birds forsook their
nests and hovered round. And old Chiron clapped
his hands together, and beat his hoofs upon the
ground, for wonder at that magic song.</p>

<p>Then Peleus kissed his boy, and wept over him,
and they went down to the ship; and Chiron came
down with them, weeping, and kissed them one by
one, and blessed them, and promised to them great
renown. And the heroes wept when they left him,
till their great hearts could weep no more; for he
was kind and just and pious, and wiser than all
beasts and men. Then he went up to a cliff, and
prayed for them, that they might come home safe
and well; while the heroes rowed away, and watched
him standing on his cliff above the sea, with his
great hands raised toward heaven, and his white
locks waving in the wind; and they strained their
eyes to watch him to the last, for they felt that they
should look on him no more.</p>

<p>So they rowed on over the long swell of the sea,
past Olympus, the seat of the Immortals, and past
the wooded bays of Athos, and Samothrace the
sacred isle; and they came past Lemnos to the
Hellespont, and through the narrow strait of
Abydos, and so on into the Propontis, which we
call Marmora now. And there they met with
Cyzicus, ruling in Asia over the Dolions, who, the
songs say, was the son of Æneas, of whom you will
hear many a tale some day. For Homer tells us
how he fought at Troy, and Virgil how he sailed
away and founded Rome. Now Cyzicus, the songs
say, welcomed the heroes, for his father had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
one of Chiron’s scholars; so he welcomed them, and
feasted them, and stored their ship with corn and
wine, and cloaks and rugs, the songs say, and
shirts, of which no doubt they stood in need.</p>

<p>But at night, while they lay sleeping, came down
on them terrible men, who lived with the bears in
the mountains, like Titans or giants in shape; for
each of them had six arms, and they fought with
young firs and pines. But Hercules killed them
all before morn with his deadly poisoned arrows;
but among them, in the darkness, he slew Cyzicus
the kindly prince.</p>

<p>Then they got to their ship and to their oars, and
Tiphys bade them cast off the hawsers and go to
sea. But as he spoke a whirlwind came, and spun
the <i>Argo</i> round, and twisted the hawsers together,
so that no man could loose them. Then Tiphys
dropped the rudder from his hand, and cried, “This
comes from the gods above.” But Jason went forward,
and asked counsel of the magic bough.</p>

<p>Then the magic bough spoke, and answered,
“This is because you have slain Cyzicus your friend.
You must appease his soul, or you will never leave
this shore.”</p>

<p>Jason went back sadly, and told the heroes what
he had heard. And they leaped on shore, and
searched till dawn; and at dawn they found the
body, all rolled in dust and blood, among the
corpses of those monstrous beasts. And they wept
over their kind host, and laid him on a fair bed,
and heaped a huge mound over him, and offered
black sheep at his tomb, and Orpheus sang a magic
song to him, that his spirit might have rest. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
then they held games at the tomb, after the custom
of those times, and Jason gave prizes to each
winner. To Ancæus he gave a golden cup, for he
wrestled best of all; and to Hercules, a silver one,
for he was the strongest of all; and to Castor, who
rode best, a golden crest; and Pollux the boxer
had a rich carpet, and to Orpheus for his song a
sandal with golden wings. But Jason himself was
the best of all the archers, and the Minuai crowned
him with an olive crown; and so, the songs say,
the soul of good Cyzicus was appeased and the
heroes went on their way in peace.</p>

<p>But when Cyzicus’ wife heard that he was dead
she died likewise of grief; and her tears became a
fountain of clear water, which flows the whole year
round.</p>

<p>Then they rowed away, the songs say, along the
Mysian shore, and past the mouth of Rhindacus,
till they found a pleasant bay, sheltered by the long
ridges of Arganthus, and by high walls of basalt
rock. There they ran the ship ashore upon the
yellow sand, and furled the sail, and took the mast
down, and lashed it in its crutch. And next they
let down the ladder, and went ashore to sport and
rest.</p>

<p>There Hercules went away into the woods, bow
in hand, to hunt wild deer; and Hylas the fair boy
slipped away after him, and followed him by stealth,
until he lost himself among the glens, and sat down
weary to rest himself by the side of a lake; and
there the water nymphs came up to look at him,
and loved him, and carried him down under the
lake to be their playfellow, forever happy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
young. And Hercules sought for him in vain,
shouting his name till all the mountains rang; but
Hylas never heard him, far down under the sparkling
lake. So while Hercules wandered searching
for him, a fair breeze sprang up, and Hercules was
nowhere to be found; and the <i>Argo</i> sailed away,
and Hercules was left behind, and never saw the
noble Phasian stream.</p>

<p>Then the Minuai came to a doleful land, where
Amycus the giant ruled, and cared nothing for
the laws of Jupiter, but challenged all strangers
to box with him, and those whom he conquered he
slew. But Pollux the boxer struck him a harder
blow than he ever felt before, and slew him; and the
Minuai went on up the Bosphorus, till they came to
the city of Phineus, the fierce Bithynian king; for
Zetes and Calais bade Jason land there, because
they had a work to do.</p>

<p>They went up from the shore toward the city,
through forests white with snow; and Phineus
came out to meet them with a lean and woeful face,
and said, “Welcome, gallant heroes, to the land of
bitter blasts, the land of cold and misery; yet I
will feast you as best I can.” And he led them in,
and set meat before them; but before they could
put their hands to their mouths, down came two
fearful monsters, the like of whom man never saw;
for they had the faces and the hair of fair maidens,
but the wings and claws of hawks; and they
snatched the meat from off the table, and flew
shrieking out above the roofs.</p>

<p>Then Phineus beat his breast and cried, “These
are the Harpies, whose names are the Whirlwind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and the Swift, the daughters of Wonder and of
the Amber-nymph, and they rob us night and day.
They carried off the daughters of Pandareus, whom
all the gods had blessed; for Venus fed them on
Olympus with honey and milk and wine; and Juno
gave them beauty and wisdom, and Minerva skill
in all the arts; but when they came to their wedding,
the Harpies snatched them both away, and
gave them to be slaves to the Fates and live in
horror all their days. And now they haunt me, and
my people, and the Bosphorus, with fearful storms
and sweep away our food from off our tables, so
that we starve in spite of all our wealth.”</p>

<p>Then up rose Zetes and Calais, the winged sons
of the North Wind, and said, “Do you not know
us, Phineus, and these wings which grow upon our
backs?” And Phineus hid his face in terror; but
he answered not a word.</p>

<p>“Because you have been a traitor, Phineus, the
Harpies haunt you night and day. Where is
Cleopatra our sister, your wife, whom you keep in
prison? and where are her two children, whom
you blinded in your rage, at the bidding of an evil
woman, and cast them out upon the rocks? Swear
to us that you will right our sister, and cast out
that wicked woman; and then we will free you
from your plague, and drive the whirlwind maidens
to the south; but if not, we will put out your eyes,
as you put out the eyes of your own sons.”</p>

<p>Then Phineus swore an oath to them, and drove
out the wicked woman; and Jason took those two
poor children, and cured their eyes with magic
herbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>But Zetes and Calais rose up sadly and said,
“Farewell now, heroes all; farewell, our dear companions,
with whom we played on Pelion in old
times; for a fate is laid upon us, and our day is
come at last, in which we must hunt the whirlwinds
over land and sea forever; and if we catch them
they die, and if not, we die ourselves.”</p>

<p>At that all the heroes wept; but the two young
men sprang aloft into the air after the Harpies,
and the battle of the winds began. The heroes
trembled in silence as they heard the shrieking of
the blasts; while the palace rocked and all the city,
and great stones were torn from the crags, and the
forest pines were hurled earthward, north and
south and east and west, and the Bosphorus boiled
white with foam, and the clouds were dashed against
the cliffs.</p>

<p>But at last the battle ended, and the Harpies
fled screaming toward the south, and the sons of
the North Wind rushed after them, and brought
clear sunshine where they passed. For many a
league they followed them, over all the isles of the
Cyclades, and away to the southwest across Hellas,
till they came to the Ionian Sea, and there they fell
upon the Echinades, at the mouth of the Achelous;
and those isles were called the Whirlwind Isles for
many a hundred years. But what became of Zetes
and Calais I know not, for the heroes never saw
them again: and some say that Hercules met them,
and quarrelled with them, and slew them with his
arrows; and some say that they fell down from
weariness and the heat of the summer sun, and that
the Sun-god buried them among the Cyclades, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the pleasant Isle of Tenos; and for many hundred
years their grave was shown there, and over it a
pillar, which turned to every wind. But those dark
storms and whirlwinds haunt the Bosphorus until
this day.</p>

<p>But the Argonauts went eastward, and out into
the open sea, which we now call the Black Sea, but
it was called the Euxine then. No Greek had ever
crossed it, and all feared that dreadful sea, and its
rocks, and shoals, and fogs, and bitter freezing
storms; and they told strange stories of it, some
false and some half true, how it stretched northward
to the ends of the earth, and the sluggish
Putrid Sea, and the everlasting night, and the
regions of the dead. So the heroes trembled, for
all their courage, as they came into that wild Black
Sea, and saw it stretching out before them, without
a shore, as far as eye could see.</p>

<p>And first Orpheus spoke, and warned them,
“We shall come now to the wandering blue rocks;
my mother warned me of them, Calliope, the immortal
muse.”</p>

<p>Soon they saw the blue rocks shining like spires
and castles of gray glass, while an ice-cold wind
blew from them and chilled the heroes’ hearts. As
they neared they could see them heaving, as they
rolled upon the long set waves, crashing and grinding
together, till the roar went up to heaven. The
sea sprang up in spouts between them, and swept
round them in white sheets of foam; but their heads
swung nodding high in air, while the wind whistled
shrill among the crags.</p>

<p>The heroes’ hearts sank within them, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
lay upon their oars in fear; but Orpheus called to
Tiphys the helmsman, “Between them we must
pass; so look ahead for an opening, and be brave,
for Juno is with us.” But Tiphys the cunning
helmsman stood silent, clenching his teeth, till he
saw a heron come flying mast-high toward the
rocks, and hover a while before them, as if looking
for a passage through. Then he cried, “Juno has
sent us a pilot; let us follow the cunning bird.”</p>

<p>Then the heron flapped to and fro a moment, till
he saw a hidden gap, and into it he rushed like an
arrow, while the heroes watched what would befall.
And the blue rocks clashed together as the bird flew
swiftly through; but they struck but a feather from
his tail, and then rebounded apart at the shock.</p>

<p>Then Tiphys cheered the heroes, and they
shouted; and the oars bent like withes beneath their
strokes as they rushed between those toppling ice-crags
and the cold blue lips of death. And ere the
rocks could meet again they had passed them, and
were safe out in the open sea.</p>

<p>After that they sailed on wearily along the Asian
coast, by the Black Cape and Thyneis, where the
hot stream of Thymbris falls into the sea, and
Sangarius, whose waters float on the Euxine, till
they came to Wolf the river, and to Wolf the
kindly king. And there died two brave heroes,
Idmon and Tiphys the wise helmsman; one died
of an evil sickness, and one a wild boar slew. So
the heroes heaped a mound above them, and set
upon it an oar on high, and left them there to sleep
together, on the far-off Lycian shore. But Idas
killed the boar, and avenged Tiphys; and Ancaios<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
took the rudder and was helmsman, and steered
them on toward the east.</p>

<p>And they went on past Sinope, and many a
mighty river’s mouth, and past many a barbarous
tribe, and the cities of the Amazons, the warlike
women of the East, till all night they heard the
clank of anvils and roar of furnace-blasts, and the
forge-fires shone like sparks through the darkness
in the mountain glens aloft; for they were come to
the shores of the Chalybes, the smiths who never
tire, but serve Mars the cruel War-god, forging
weapons day and night.</p>

<p>At day-dawn they looked eastward, and midway
between the sea and the sky they saw white snow-peaks
hanging, glittering sharp and bright above
the clouds. And they knew that they were come to
Caucasus, at the end of all the earth: Caucasus the
highest of all mountains, the father of the rivers
of the East. On this peak lies chained the Titan,
while a vulture tears his heart; and at his feet are
piled dark forests round the magic Colchian land.</p>

<p>And they rowed three days to the eastward, while
Caucasus rose higher hour by hour, till they saw
the dark stream of Phasis rushing headlong to the
sea, and, shining above the tree-tops, the golden
roofs of King Aietes, the child of the Sun. Then
out spoke Ancaios the helmsman, “We are come
to our goal at last, for there are the roofs of Aietes,
and the woods where all poisons grow; but who can
tell us where among them is hid the Golden Fleece?
Many a toil must we bear ere we find it, and bring
it home to Greece.”</p>

<p>But Jason cheered the heroes, for his heart was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
high and bold; and he said, “I will go alone up to
Aietes, though he be the child of the Sun, and win
him with soft words. Better so than to go all together,
and to come to blows at once.” But the
Minuai would not stay behind, so they rowed boldly
up the stream.</p>

<p>And a dream came to Aietes, and filled his heart
with fear. He thought he saw a shining star, which
fell into his daughter’s lap; and that Medea his
daughter took it gladly, and carried it to the river-side,
and cast it in, and there the whirling river bore
it down, and out into the Black Sea. Then he
leaped up in fear, and bade his servants bring his
chariot, that he might go down to the river-side and
appease the nymphs, and the heroes whose spirits
haunt the bank. So he went down in his golden
chariot, and his daughters by his side, Medea the
fair witch-maiden, and Chalciope, who had been
Phrixus’ wife, and behind him a crowd of servants
and soldiers, for he was a rich and mighty prince.</p>

<p>As he drove down by the reedy river he saw
<i>Argo</i> sliding up beneath the bank, and many a
hero in her, like Immortals for beauty and for
strength, as their weapons glittered round them in
the level morning sunlight, through the white mist
of the stream. But Jason was the noblest of all;
for Juno, who loved him, gave him beauty and tallness
and vigorous manhood.</p>

<p>And when they came near together and looked
into each other’s eyes the heroes were awed before
Aietes as he shone in his chariot, like his father the
glorious Sun; for his robes were of rich gold tissue,
and the rays of his diadem flashed fire, and in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
hand he bore a jewelled scepter, which glittered
like the stars; and sternly he looked at them under
his brows, and sternly he spoke and loud: “Who
are you, and what want you here, that you come
to the shore of Cutaia? Do you take no account
of my rule, nor of my people the Colchians who
serve me, who never tired yet in the battle, and
know well how to face an invader?”</p>

<p>And the heroes sat silent before the face of that
ancient king. But Juno the awful goddess put courage
into Jason’s heart, and he rose and shouted
loudly in answer, “We are no pirates nor lawless
men. We come not to plunder and to ravage, or
carry away slaves from your land; but my uncle
the son of Neptune, Pelias the Minuan king, he it
is who has set me on a quest to bring home the
Golden Fleece. And these, too, my bold comrades,
are no nameless men; for some are the sons of Immortals,
and some of heroes far renowned. And
we, too, never tire in battle, and know well how to
give blows and to take: yet we wish to be guests
at your table: it will be better so for both.”</p>

<p>Then Aietes’ rage rushed up like a whirlwind,
and his eyes flashed fire as he heard; but he crushed
his anger down in his breast, and spoke mildly a
cunning speech:</p>

<p>“If you will fight for the fleece with my Colchians,
then many a man must die. But do you
indeed expect to win from me the fleece in fight?
So few you are that if you be worsted I can load
your ship with your corpses. But if you will be
ruled by me, you will find it better far to choose the
best man among you, and let him fulfil the labors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
which I demand. Then I will give him the Golden
Fleece for a prize and a glory to you all.”</p>

<p>So saying, he turned his horses and drove back
in silence to the town. And the Minuai sat silent
with sorrow, and longed for Hercules and his
strength; for there was no facing the thousands of
the Colchians and the fearful chance of war.</p>

<p>But Chalciope, Phrixus’ widow, went weeping
to the town; for she remembered her Minuan husband,
and all the pleasures of her youth, while she
watched the fair faces of his kinsmen, and their
long locks of golden hair. And she whispered to
Medea, her sister, “Why should all these brave men
die? why does not my father give them up the
fleece, that my husband’s spirit may have rest?”</p>

<p>And Medea’s heart pitied the heroes, and Jason
most of all; and she answered, “Our father is stern
and terrible, and who can win the Golden Fleece?”
But Chalciope said, “These men are not like our
men; there is nothing which they cannot dare nor
do.”</p>

<p>And Medea thought of Jason and his brave
countenance, and said, “If there was one among
them who knew no fear, I could show him how to
win the fleece.”</p>

<p>So in the dusk of evening they went down to the
river-side, Chalciope and Medea the witch-maiden,
and Argus, Phrixus’ son. And Argus the boy
crept forward, among the beds of reeds, till he
came where the heroes were sleeping, on the thwarts
of the ship, beneath the bank, while Jason kept
ward on shore, and leaned upon his lance full of
thought. And the boy came to Jason, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
“I am the son of Phrixus, your cousin; and Chalciope
my mother waits for you, to talk about the
Golden Fleece.”</p>

<p>Then Jason went boldly with the boy, and found
the two princesses standing; and when Chalciope
saw him she wept, and took his hands, and cried:
“O cousin of my beloved, go home before you die!”</p>

<p>“It would be base to go home now, fair princess,
and to have sailed all these seas in vain.” Then
both the princesses besought him; but Jason said,
“It is too late.”</p>

<p>“But you know not,” said Medea, “what he must
do who would win the fleece. He must tame the
two brazen-footed bulls, who breathe devouring
flame; and with them he must plow ere nightfall
four acres in the field of Mars; and he must sow
them with serpents’ teeth, of which each tooth
springs up into an armed man. Then he must fight
with all those warriors; and little will it profit him
to conquer them, for the fleece is guarded by a serpent,
more huge than any mountain pine; and over
his body you must step if you would reach the
Golden Fleece.”</p>

<p>Then Jason laughed bitterly. “Unjustly is that
fleece kept here, and by an unjust and lawless
king; and unjustly shall I die in my youth, for I
will attempt it ere another sun be set.”</p>

<p>Then Medea trembled, and said, “No mortal
man can reach that fleece unless I guide him
through. For round it, beyond the river, is a wall
full nine ells high, with lofty towers and buttresses,
and mighty gates of threefold brass; and over the
gates the wall is arched, with golden battlements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
above. And over the gateway sits Brimo, the wild
witch-huntress of the woods, brandishing a pine-torch
in her hands, while her mad hounds howl
around. No man dare meet her or look on her, but
only I her priestess, and she watches far and wide
lest any stranger should come near.”</p>

<p>“No wall so high but it may be climbed at last,
and no wood so thick but it may be crawled
through; no serpent so wary but he may be
charmed, or witch-queen so fierce but spells may
soothe her; and I may yet win the Golden Fleece,
if a wise maiden help bold men.”</p>

<p>And he looked at Medea cunningly, and held her
with his glittering eye, till she blushed and trembled,
and said: “Who can face the fire of the bull’s
breath, and fight ten thousand armed men?”</p>

<p>“He whom you help,” said Jason, flattering her,
“for your fame is spread over all the earth. Are
you not the queen of all enchantresses, wiser even
than your sister Circe, in her fairy island in the
West?”</p>

<p>“Would that I were with my sister Circe in her
fairy island in the West, far away from sore temptation
and thoughts which tear the heart! But if it
must be so—for why should you die?—I have an
ointment here; I made it from the magic ice-flower
which sprang from Prometheus’ wound, above the
clouds on Caucasus, in the dreary fields of snow.
Anoint yourself with that, and you shall have in
you seven men’s strength; and anoint your shield
with it, and neither fire nor sword can harm you.
But what you begin you must end before sunset,
for its virtue lasts only one day. And anoint your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
helmet with it before you sow the serpents’ teeth;
and when the sons of earth spring up, cast your
helmet among their ranks, and the deadly crop of
the War-god’s field will mow itself, and perish.”</p>

<p>Then Jason fell on his knees before her, and
thanked her and kissed her hands; and she gave
him the vase of ointment, and fled trembling
through the reeds. And Jason told his comrades
what had happened, and showed them the
box of ointment; and all rejoiced but Idas, and he
grew mad with envy.</p>

<p>At sunrise Jason went and bathed, and anointed
himself from head to foot, and his shield, and his
helmet, and his weapons, and bade his comrades
try the spell. So they tried to bend his lance, but
it stood like an iron bar; and Idas in spite hewed
at it with his sword, but the blade flew to splinters
in his face. Then they hurled their lances at his
shield, but the spear-points turned like lead; and
Caineus tried to throw him, but he never stirred a
foot; and Pollux struck him with his fist a blow
which would have killed an ox, but Jason only
smiled, and the heroes danced about him with delight;
and he leaped, and ran, and shouted in the
joy of that enormous strength, till the sun rose, and
it was time to go and claim Aietes’ promise.</p>

<p>So he sent up Telamon and Aithalides to tell
Aietes that he was ready for the fight; and they
went up among the marble walls and beneath the
roofs of gold, and stood in Aietes’ hall while he
grew pale with rage.</p>

<p>“Fulfil your promise to us, child of the blazing
Sun. Give us the serpents’ teeth, and let loose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fiery bulls; for we have found a champion among
us who can win the Golden Fleece.”</p>

<p>And Aietes bit his lips, for he fancied that they
had fled away by night; but he could not go back
from his promise; so he gave them the serpents’
teeth. Then he called for his chariot and his horses,
and sent heralds through all the town; and all the
people went out with him to the dreadful War-god’s
field.</p>

<p>And there Aietes sat upon his throne, with his
warriors on each hand, thousands and tens of thousands,
clothed from head to foot in steel chain-mail.
And the people and the women crowded to
every window and bank and wall; while the Minuai
stood together, a mere handful in the midst of that
great host. Chalciope was there and Argus, trembling,
and Medea, wrapped closely in her veil; but
Aietes did not know that she was muttering cunning
spells between her lips.</p>

<p>Then Jason cried, “Fulfil your promise, and let
your fiery bulls come forth.”</p>

<p>Then Aietes bade open the gates, and the magic
bulls leaped out. Their brazen hoofs rang upon
the ground, and their nostrils sent out sheets of
flame, as they rushed with lowered heads upon
Jason; but he never flinched a step. The flame of
their breath swept round him, but it singed not a
hair of his head; and the bulls stopped short and
trembled when Medea began her spell.</p>

<p>Then Jason sprang upon the nearest and seized
him by the horn; and up and down they wrestled,
till the bull fell grovelling on his knees; for the
heart of the brute died within him; and his mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
limbs were loosed, beneath the steadfast eye of that
dark witch-maiden and the magic whisper of her
lips.</p>

<p>So both the bulls were tamed and yoked; and
Jason bound them to the plow, and goaded them
onward with his lance till he had plowed the sacred
field.</p>

<p>And all the Minuai shouted; but Aietes bit his
lips with rage for the half of Jason’s work was
over, and the sun was yet high in heaven.</p>

<p>Then he took the serpents’ teeth and sowed them,
and waited what would befall. But Medea looked
at him and at his helmet, lest he should forget the
lesson she had taught.</p>

<p>Every furrow heaved and bubbled, and out of
every clod arose a man. Out of the earth they rose
by thousands, each clad from head to foot in steel,
and drew their swords and rushed on Jason, where
he stood in the midst alone. Then the Minuai grew
pale with fear for him; but Aietes laughed a bitter
laugh. “See! if I had not warriors enough already
round me, I could call them out of the bosom of
the earth.”</p>

<p>But Jason snatched off his helmet, and hurled it
into the thickest of the throng. And blind madness
came upon them, suspicion, hate, and fear; and one
cried to his fellow, “Thou didst strike me!” and
another, “Thou art Jason; thou shalt die!” So
fury seized those earth-born phantoms, and each
turned his hand against the rest; and they fought
and were never weary, till they all lay dead upon
the ground. Then the magic furrows opened, and
the kind earth took them home into her breast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and the grass grew up all green again above them,
and Jason’s work was done.</p>

<p>Then the Minuai rose and shouted, till Prometheus
heard them from his crag. And Jason cried,
“Lead me to the fleece this moment, before the sun
goes down.”</p>

<p>But Aietes thought, “He has conquered the bulls,
and sown and reaped the deadly crop. Who is
this who is proof against all magic? He may kill
the serpent yet.” So he delayed, and sat taking
counsel with his princes till the sun went down and
all was dark. Then he bade a herald cry, “Every
man to his home for to-night. To-morrow we will
meet these heroes, and speak about the Golden
Fleece.” Then he turned and looked at Medea.
“This is your doing, false witch-maid! You have
helped these yellow-haired strangers, and brought
shame upon your father and yourself!”</p>

<p>Medea shrank and trembled, and her face grew
pale with fear; and Aietes knew that she was
guilty, and whispered, “If they win the fleece, you
die!”</p>

<p>But the Minuai marched toward their ship,
growling like lions cheated of their prey; for they
saw that Aietes meant to mock them, and to cheat
them out of all their toil. And Oileus said, “Let
us go to the grove together, and take the fleece by
force.”</p>

<p>And Idas the rash cried, “Let us draw lots who
shall go in first; for, while the dragon is devouring
one, the rest can slay him and carry off the fleece
in peace.” But Jason held them back, though he
praised them; for he hoped for Medea’s help.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
And after a while Medea came trembling, and wept
a long while before she spoke. And at last: “My
end is come, and I must die; for my father has
found out that I have helped you. You he would
kill if he dared; but he will not harm you, because
you have been his guests. Go, then, go, and remember
poor Medea when you are far away across
the sea.” But all the heroes cried:</p>

<p>“If you die, we die with you; for without you we
cannot win the fleece, and home we will not go
without it, but fall here fighting to the last man.”</p>

<p>“You need not die,” said Jason. “Flee home
with us across the sea. Show us first how to win
the fleece; for you can do it. Why else are you the
priestess of the grove? Show us but how to win
the fleece, and come with us, and you shall be my
queen, and rule over the rich princes of the Minuai,
in Iolcos by the sea.” And all the heroes pressed
round, and vowed to her that she should be their
queen.</p>

<p>Medea wept, and shuddered, and hid her face in
her hands; for her heart yearned after her sisters
and her playfellows, and the home where she was
brought up as a child. But at last she looked up
at Jason, and spoke between her sobs: “Must I
leave my home and my people, to wander with
strangers across the sea? The lot is cast, and I
must endure it. I will show you how to win the
Golden Fleece. Bring up your ship to the wood-side,
and moor her there against the bank; and let
Jason come up at midnight, and one brave comrade
with him, and meet me beneath the wall.”</p>

<p>Then all the heroes cried together, “I will go!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
“and I!” “and I!” And Idas the rash grew mad
with envy; for he longed to be foremost in all things.
But Medea calmed them, and said, “Orpheus shall
go with Jason, and bring his magic harp; for I hear
of him that he is the king of all minstrels, and can
charm all things on earth.”</p>

<p>And Orpheus laughed for joy, and clapped his
hands, because the choice had fallen on him; for in
those days poets and singers were as bold warriors
as the best.</p>

<p>So at midnight they went up the bank, and found
Medea; and besides came Absyrtus her young
brother, leading a yearling lamb.</p>

<p>Then Medea brought them to a thicket beside the
War-god’s gate; and there she bade Jason dig a
ditch, and kill the lamb, and leave it there, and
strew on it magic herbs and honey from the honeycomb.</p>

<p>Then sprang up through the earth, with the red
fire flashing before her, Brimo the wild witch-huntress,
while her mad hounds howled around. She
had one head like a horse’s, and another like a
ravening hound’s, and another like a hissing
snake’s and a sword in either hand. And she leaped
into the ditch with her hounds, and they ate and
drank their fill, while Jason and Orpheus trembled,
and Medea hid her eyes. And at last the witch-queen
vanished, and fled with her hounds into the
woods; and the bars of the gates fell down, and the
brazen doors flew wide, and Medea and the heroes
ran forward and hurried through the poison wood,
among the dark stems of the mighty beeches,
guided by the gleam of the Golden Fleece, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
they saw it hanging on one vast tree in the midst.
And Jason would have sprung to seize it; but
Medea held him back, and pointed, shuddering, to
the tree-foot, where the mighty serpent lay, coiled
in and out among the roots, with a body like a
mountain pine. His coils stretched many a fathom,
spangled with bronze and gold; and half of him
they could see, but no more, for the rest lay in the
darkness beyond.</p>

<p>And when he saw them coming he lifted up his
head, and watched them with his small bright eyes,
and flashed his forked tongue, and roared like the
fire among the woodlands, till the forest tossed and
groaned. For his cries shook the trees from leaf to
root, and swept over the long reaches of the river,
and over Aietes’ hall, and woke the sleepers in the
city, till mothers clasped their children in their fear.</p>

<p>But Medea called gently to him, and he stretched
out his long spotted neck, and licked her hand, and
looked up in her face, as if to ask for food. Then
she made a sign to Orpheus, and he began his
magic song.</p>

<p>And as he sung, the forest grew calm again, and
the leaves on every tree hung still; and the serpent’s
head sank down, and his brazen coils grew
limp, and his glittering eyes closed lazily, till he
breathed as gently as a child, while Orpheus called
to pleasant Slumber, who gives peace to men, and
beasts, and waves.</p>

<p>Then Jason leaped forward warily, and stepped
across that mighty snake, and tore the fleece from
off the tree-trunk; and the four rushed down the
garden, to the bank where the <i>Argo</i> lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a silence for a moment, while Jason
held the Golden Fleece on high. Then he cried,
“Go now, good <i>Argo</i>, swift and steady, if ever you
would see Pelion more.” And she went, as the
heroes drove her, grim and silent all, with muffled
oars, till the pinewood bent like willow in their
hands, and stout <i>Argo</i> groaned beneath their
strokes.</p>

<p>On and on, beneath the dewy darkness, they fled
swiftly down the swirling stream; underneath
black walls, and temples, and the castles of the
princes of the East; past sluice-mouths, and fragrant
gardens, and groves of all strange fruits;
past marshes where fat kine lay sleeping, and long
beds of whispering reeds; till they heard the merry
music of the surge upon the bar, as it tumbled in
the moonlight all alone.</p>

<p>Into the surge they rushed, and <i>Argo</i> leaped the
breakers like a horse; for she knew the time was
come to show her mettle, and win honor for the
heroes and herself. Into the surge they rushed,
and <i>Argo</i> leaped the breakers like a horse, till the
heroes stopped all panting, each man upon his oar,
as she slid into the still broad sea.</p>

<p>Then Orpheus took his harp and sang a pæan,
till the heroes’ hearts rose high again; and they
rowed on stoutly and steadfastly, away into the
darkness of the West.</p>

<h3 id="HUNTING_THE_CALYDONIAN_BOAR">HUNTING THE CALYDONIAN BOAR</h3>

<p class="author">By Elsie Finnimore Buckley</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the city of Calydon long ago there were great
rejoicings because the queen Althæa had given
birth to a son, her first-born, who, if he grew to
years of manhood, would in time sit upon the
throne of his father Œneus, and rule the land.
Some seven days after the child was born it chanced
that the queen was lying in her chamber, with the
babe upon her breast.</p>

<p>As she lay she watched the shadows playing up
and down upon the walls, and to her eyes they took
strange forms of men and beasts. Now it was a
great fight she saw, with horses and chariots rushing
over a plain, and mighty warriors meeting face
to face in battle; now it was a hunt, with winding
of horns and dogs straining at the leash, and a
white-tusked boar breaking through a thicket. But
whether it was a hunt or whether it was a battle,
everywhere there was one figure of a man she
watched—a man tall and fair and brave, who stood
out conspicuous among his fellows—such a hero as
her son might grow to be if he lived till years of
manhood. And she prayed that her vision might
come true, and her son grow up to be a hero—a
man mighty in sport and mighty in battle. In time
the flames died down, and the fire burned clear and
still upon the hearth. The queen’s eyes grew heavy,
and she was about to turn on her side to sleep when
a strange thing happened, which took from her all
desire for rest. The wall of the room in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
her, which had glowed bright and cheery in the firelight,
grew gray and misty and seemed to vanish
before her eyes, and through the opening there
came towards her the forms of three strange
women, taller and more terrible than any women
of earth. The first one carried in her hand a skein
of thread, the second a spindle, and the third a pair
of great sharp shears. The queen lay still and
motionless with terror as they came forward slowly
arm in arm and stood beside the couch, looking
down upon the child at her breast. At length the
first one spoke.</p>

<p>“I give to thy child, Althæa, a thread of life exceeding
bright and fair.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said the second, “will weave that thread
into dark places, where it will shine the brighter
for the darkness round about, and bring him
honor and great renown.”</p>

<p>The third one said never a word, but walked
slowly round the couch till she stood before the fire
on the hearth. A great brand had fallen from the
grate, and lay smouldering on the stones. Bending
down, she took it in her hand, and thrust it deep
into the red-hot heart of the fire, and stood watching
it till it was well alight, and the tongues of
flame shot crackling upwards. Then she turned
towards the queen.</p>

<p>“As soon as that brand upon the fire is consumed,”
she said, “I will cut the shining thread
with my shears, and his life shall be as ashes cast
forth upon the wind.”</p>

<p>With a cry of terror the queen sprang up from
her couch, rushed across the room, and, drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
forth the blazing brand from the fire, she smothered
it in her gown, and crushed it beneath her bare feet,
till not a live spark remained about it. Then she
hid it in a secret place where she alone could find it,
and cast herself upon her couch and knew no more.</p>

<p>For many a long day she lay between life and
death, but at last the gods had mercy, and her
strength came slowly back to her. But when anyone
asked her the cause of her burning, she would
shudder and mutter some strange tale of a brand
which fell from the fire, and would have burnt out
the life of her child. What she meant no one ever
knew, but they thought that the gods had stricken
her with a sudden fever, and that, not knowing
what she did, she had burnt herself in the fire. But
of the half-burnt brand and of the word of the
Fates they knew nothing, for Althæa had said in
her heart:</p>

<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_105">—page 105</a></p>

<p class="caption"><i>From the painting by Maxfield Parrish</i></p>

</div>

<p>“The Fates have spoken, and their word shall
surely come to pass. A fine and fair thread of life
has Lachesis given to my son, and Clotho will weave
it into dark places, where it shall shine exceeding
bright. The gifts they have given are good. The
hand of Atropos alone is against him, and she has
measured his life by the life of a frail piece of wood.
But so long as the gods shall give me strength
no careless hand shall place that brand upon the
flames, and no man shall know the secret of his
life, for grief or madness may turn even the heart
of a friend. On me, and on me alone, shall my
son’s life rest; for well do I know that neither
prayer nor sacrifice can avail to turn the heart of
Atropos, the Unswerving One.” So she kept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
brand securely hidden where she alone could find it.
Many other fair children did she bear to Œneus
the king, but best of them all she loved Meleager,
her first-born; for the word that the Fates had
spoken came true. He grew to be a great warrior
and a mighty man, and was feared by his foes and
loved by his friends through the length and breadth
of the land. In all the country-side there was no
man who could hurl the javelin with such force and
skill as he, and whenever he went forth to battle the
victory lay with the men of Calydon, and he was
called the savior and protector of his city.</p>

<p>When he was in the flower of his manhood,
the call of Jason came from far Iolcos for all the
heroes of Greece to join him in his search for the
Golden Fleece. Amongst them sailed Meleager in
the good ship <i>Argo</i>, and came to the land of the
dusky Colchians on the shores of the Black Sea.
He played his part like a man, and came back to
Calydon with a fair name for courage and endurance.
Then was he hoisted on the shoulders of his
countrymen and carried through the streets of the
city, and feasted right royally in his father’s house.</p>

<p>Soon after his return it chanced that the harvest
was more plentiful than it had ever been within
the memory of man. Wherefore Œneus the king
ordered a great thanksgiving to be held throughout
the land in honor of Bacchus and Ceres and
Minerva, who had given such good gifts to men.
At every shrine and temple the altars smoked with
sacrifice, and glad bands of youths and maidens
with garlands on their heads danced hand in hand
around, singing the song of the harvest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>When Diana, the huntress, saw that everywhere
the altars smoked in honor of Ceres and Bacchus
and Minerva, but that never a single stone was
raised to her, she was filled with jealousy and wrath.
One night, when all the land lay sleeping, she left
the mountains, where she loved to hunt, and came
down to Calydon. The arrows in her quiver rattled
as she strode along in her wrath, and the flash of
her eyes was as the flash of summer lightning across
the sky. With great swinging strides she came
and stood over Œneus as he slept.</p>

<p>“O king,” she said, “too long have I been patient
and waited for my dues; but I will suffer thine
ingratitude no more. When the young corn stands
green upon the plain, and the vine-leaves are shooting,
and the trees cast once more their shade upon
the bare hill-side, then shalt thou have cause to
know my power. Broad and dark are the forests,
and many a wild beast lurks therein that is tame at
my word alone. One of these will I let loose upon
thy land. Many a fair field shall be trodden underfoot,
and many a vineyard and olive-grove laid
waste—yea, and red blood shall flow, ere my wrath
be assuaged, and I take away the pests from your
midst. I have spoken, and no sacrifice shall turn
me from my word.”</p>

<p>Thus did she speak, saying the words in his ear,
and turned and left the room by the way she had
come. With a start he awoke from his sleep and
looked around him, but no one could he see. Only
a sudden storm of wind lashed the branches of the
trees against each other, and a dark cloud hid the
face of the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“The sad winter-time is coming,” he thought,
“with its storms and its darkened days. Yet, lest
there be aught in my dream, I will remember Diana
to-morrow, and her altars, too, shall smoke with
sacrifice.”</p>

<p>So on the morrow a great festival was held in
honor of Diana, the maiden huntress, and Œneus
laid aside all thought of his dream. But when the
spring-time came and the early summer, he had
cause to remember it with sorrow, for out of the
forests there came a great boar which laid waste
all the country, right and left. In size he was
more huge than an ox of Epirus, whose oxen are
the largest in the world, and the bristles on his
neck stood up like spikes. His breath was as a
flame of fire that burned up all that stood in his
way, and his cruel little eyes gleamed red with
blood. Over the cornfields he raged, and trampled
the green blades beneath his hoofs, and with his
strong, white tusks he tore down the vine-branches
and broke the overhanging boughs of the olive, so
that the young berries and fruit lay spoilt upon
the ground. Not only did he lay waste the fields,
but the flocks and herds on the pasture-land were
not safe from his attack, and neither shepherds
nor dogs could protect them from his fury.
Through all the country-side the people fled in
terror for their lives, and hid within the city walls,
only now and again a band of the bravest would go
forth and lay nets and snares for him; but so great
was the strength of the beast that he broke through
every trap they could devise, and, killing any man
who stood in his path, he would return, with greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
fury than before, to his attack upon the fields and
cattle. At length things came to such a pass that,
unless the monster could be checked, famine would
ere long stare the people in the face. When Meleager
saw that neither prayer nor sacrifice would
turn the heart of Diana, nor any ordinary hunting
put an end to the boar, he determined to gather
around him a band of heroes who, for the sake of
glory, would come together for the hunt, and either
kill the beast or perish themselves in the attempt.
So he sent a proclamation far and wide through all
the kingdoms of Greece.</p>

<p>“O men of Greece,” he said, “the fair plains of
Calydon lie trodden underfoot by a grievous monster,
and her people are fallen upon evil days.
Come hither and help us, all ye who love adventure,
and fear not risk nor peril, ye seasoned warriors
whose spirit is not dead within you, and ye young
men who have yet your name to win. Come hither
to us, and we will give you fair sport and good
cheer withal.”</p>

<p>In answer to his call there flocked from far and
wide to Calydon a great host of brave men, and
mighty was the muster which gathered beneath the
roof of Œneus for the hunting of the boar. Jason
himself came, the leader of the Argonauts, and Castor
and Pollux, the great twin brethren, whose
stars are in the sky. There was Theseus, too, who
slew the Minotaur, and Peirithous his friend, who
went down with him to Hades, and tried to carry
off Proserpine from the King of the Dead. And
swift-footed Idas came, and Lynceus, his brother,
whose eyes were so sharp that they could see into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the center of the earth. Others were there besides,
whose names are too many to tell, and Toxeus and
Plexippus, the brothers of Althæa the queen, whom
she loved as she loved her own son Meleager. In
the great hall a sumptuous feast was spread, and
loud was the laughter and bright were the faces, as
one friend met another he had not seen for many
a long day. The feast was well under way when
one of the attendants whispered in the ear of the
king that yet another guest had come for the hunting
of the boar.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked the king.</p>

<p>“My lord, I know not,” the man replied.</p>

<p>“Well, keep him not standing without, at all
events,” said Œneus, “but show him in here, and
we will make him welcome with the rest.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the man returned, and held
back the curtain of the great doorway for the newcomer
to enter. All eyes were turned eagerly that
way to see who it might be, and a murmur of surprise
ran round the hall; for they saw upon the
threshold no stalwart warrior, as they had expected,
but a maiden young and beautiful. She was clad
in a hunter’s tunic, which fell to her knee, and her
legs were strapped about with leathern thongs.
Crosswise about her body she wore a girdle, from
which hung a quiver full of arrows, and with her
right hand she leant on a great ashen bow like a
staff. Her shining hair fell back in waves from
her forehead, and was gathered up in a coil behind,
and she held her head up proudly and gazed round
on the company unabashed. The glow of her cheek
and the spring of her step told of life in the open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and of health-giving sport over hill and dale, so
that she might have been Diana herself come down
from her hunting on the mountains.</p>

<p>She looked round the hall till her eyes fell on
Œneus, the host, in the place of honor, and in no
wise troubled by the silence which her coming had
caused, she said: “Sire, for my late-coming I crave
thy pardon. Doubtless some of thy guests have
come from more distant lands than I, but, as ill-luck
would have it, I chose to come by way of the
sea instead of by the isthmus. For a whole day I
ate out my heart with waiting till the wind fell, and
I could cross over in safety.”</p>

<p>Concealing his surprise as best he could, Œneus
answered: “Maiden, we thank thee for thy coming,
and make thee right welcome in our halls. Yet
we would know thy name who, a woman all alone,
hast crossed barren tracts of land and stormy seas
unflinching, and come to take part in a hunt which
is no mere child’s sport, but a perilous venture, in
which strong men might hesitate to risk their lives
and limbs.”</p>

<p>As she listened to his words she smiled. “O
king,” she said, “thou hidest thy surprise but ill.
Yet am I not offended, nor will I make a mystery
of who I am. My name is Atalanta, and I come
from the mountains of Arcadia, where all day long
I hunt with the nymphs over hill and over dale, and
through the dark forests, following in the footsteps
of her we serve, great Diana the huntress. At her
command I stand before thee now, for she said to
me, ‘Atalanta, the land of Calydon lies groaning
beneath the curse, wherewith I cursed them because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
they forgot me, and gave me not my dues. But do
thou go and help them, and for thy sake I will
lay aside my wrath, and let them slay the monster
that I sent against them. Yet without thee shall
they not accomplish it, but the glory of the hunt
shall be thine.’ Thus did she speak, and in obedience
to her word am I come.”</p>

<p>When she had spoken, a murmur ran round the
hall, and each man, determined in his mind that no
mere woman should surpass him in courage and
strength. The sons of Thestius, the queen’s brothers,
especially looked askance at her, and their
hearts were filled with jealousy and wrath; for
there seemed no reason why she should not be a
match for any man among them, in a trial where
swiftness of foot and sureness of eye would avail
as much as brute force. When Meleager saw their
dark looks he was very angry that they should so
far forget their good breeding as to fail in welcoming
a guest, and he rose from his seat and went
towards her.</p>

<p>“O maiden,” he said, “we make thee right welcome
to our halls, and we thank thee because thou
hast heard our appeal, and art come to help us in
the day of our trouble. Come, now, and sit thee
down, and make glad thy heart with meat and
wine, for thou must need it sorely after thy long
journeying.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he took her by the hand and set
her in a place of honor between his father and
himself, and saw that she had her fill of the good
fare on the board. As he sat beside her and talked
with her, his heart was kindled with love, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was exceeding fair to look upon; and the more he
thought upon the morrow’s hunting, the more loath
was he that she should risk her life in it. At length
he said:</p>

<p>“Atalanta, surely thou knowest not what manner
of beast it is that we are gathered together to destroy.
Thou hast hunted the swift-footed stag,
perchance, through the greenwood, but never a
monster so fierce as this boar that Diana has sent
against us. I tell thee, it will be no child’s play,
but a matter of death to some of us. Hast thou no
mother or father to mourn thee if any evil chance
befall, or any lover who is longing for thy return?
Think well ere it be too late.”</p>

<p>But she laughed aloud at his words. “Thou
takest me for some drooping damsel that sits at
home and spins, and faints if she see but a drop
of blood. I tell thee, I know neither father, nor
mother, nor husband, nor brother, and I love but
little the lot of womenkind. Never have I lived
within four walls, and the first roof that covered
me was the forest-trees of Mount Parthenius.
Whence I came or how I got to Parthenius no one
can tell, and I have no wish to find out. As for
savage beasts, had I not the eyes of a hawk and the
feet of a deer, I had not been safe ten seconds on
the uplands of Arcadia. For there dwells a fierce
tribe of centaurs—monsters half human and half
horse—who have the passions of men and the
strength of beasts. These pursued me over hill and
dale, and I fled like the wind before them; but ever
and anon I found time to turn and let fly from my
bow a dart which fell but seldom short of the mark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
So that after a time they gave up in despair, and
molested me no more. So talk not to me of fierce
beasts or of danger.”</p>

<p>And nothing that Meleager could say would
turn her from her purpose. But across the board
he saw the eyes of Toxeus and Plexippus, his
mother’s brothers, fixed upon him, and their brows
were dark and lowering as they frowned upon him
and Atalanta. So he said no more, lest they should
discover his secret and taunt him. As for Atalanta,
a stone would have returned his love as readily
as she. For a companion in the hunt she liked
him full well, but to give up her maiden life for
his sake was as far from her thoughts as the east
is from the west.</p>

<p>When the morrow dawned, great was the bustle
and confusion in the court of the palace, where all
were to meet together for the hunting of the boar.
Attendants ran this way and that to fetch and
carry for their masters, and, as the huntsman blew
his horn, the hounds barked impatiently, and
strained, whining, at their leashes. At length,
when all was ready, Althæa with her maidens came
forth into the portico, and bade farewell to her
guests, her husband, her brothers, and to Meleager,
her son. “God speed thee, my son,” she said, as
she looked proudly on him, “and good luck to thy
hunting.”</p>

<p>Then she stood on the step and waved to them
with a smile as they turned to look back at her before
the curve of the roadway hid them from sight.
But though a smile was on her lips, her eyes were
full of tears, and her heart within her was dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with a dim foreshadowing of evil. With a heavy
step, she turned and went into the house, and as
she passed the altar by the hearth she stopped and
bowed her head. “Great Diana,” she prayed,
“have mercy and bring my loved ones safely back
to me this day.”</p>

<p>Then she went to her chamber and drew forth
from its hiding-place the half-burnt brand on which
her son’s life depended. “His life, at any rate, is
safe,” she thought, “so long as this brand is in my
keeping.” And she hid it away again where she
knew no one could find it, and set to work restlessly,
to while away the hours as best she could,
till the hunters should come home.</p>

<p>They, meanwhile, had gone their way up the
steep path which led into the mountains and deep
into the heart of the forest, where they knew their
prey was lurking. Soon they came upon the
track of his hoofs leading to the dry bed of a
stream, where the rushes and reeds grew high in
the marsh-land, and the bending willows cast their
shadow over the spot he had chosen for his lair.
Here they spread the nets cautiously about, and
stationed themselves at every point of vantage,
and, when all was ready, let loose the hounds, and
waited for the boar to come forth from his hiding-place.
Not long did they have to wait. With a
snort of rage he rushed out. The breath from his
nostrils came forth like steam, and the white foam
flew from his mouth and covered his bristly sides
and neck. Quick as lightning, he made for the
first man he could see, and the tramp of his hoofs
re-echoed through the woods like thunder as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
came upon the hard ground. As soon as he rushed
out, a shower of missiles fell towards him from
every side, but some were aimed awry or fell too
far or too short of him, and those that touched him
slipped aside on his tough hide; and he broke
through the nets that had been spread to catch him,
and galloped away unharmed, whilst two of the
hunters, who stood in his path, and had not been
able to rush aside in time, lay groaning on the
ground with the iron mark of his hoof upon them.
When the rest saw that he had escaped they gave
chase with all speed, headed by Castor and Pollux,
on their white horses, and Atalanta close beside
them, running swiftly as the wind. Ahead of
them the woodland track gave a sudden turn to the
left, and the boar, rushing blindly forward, would
have plunged into the undergrowth and bushes,
and escaped beyond range of their darts. But Atalanta,
seeing what must happen, stopped short in
the chase. Quick as thought, she put an arrow to
the string, and let fly at the great beast ahead; and
Diana, true to her word, guided the arrow so that
it pierced him in the vital part behind the ear.
With a snort of pain and fury, he turned round
upon the hunters and charged down towards them
as they came up from behind, and great would have
been the havoc he had wrought among them but
for Meleager. As the brute bore down, he leaped
lightly to one side, and, gathering together all his
strength, buried the spear deep into the beast’s
black shoulder, and felled him to the earth with the
force of his blow. Immediately the others gathered
round, and helped to finish the work that Meleager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
had begun, and soon the monster lay dead upon
the ground.</p>

<p>Then Meleager, with his foot upon the boar’s
head, spoke to the hunters. “My friends,” he said,
“I thank you all for the courage and devotion you
have shown this day. My land can once more
raise her head in joy, for the monster that wrought
such havoc in her fields lies dead here at my feet.
Yet the price of his death has not been light, my
friends.” And they bowed their heads in silence,
as they remembered the two whom the boar had
struck in his rush, one of whom was now dead.
“Yet those who have suffered, have suffered gloriously,
giving up themselves, as brave men must,
for the sake of others, and their names shall surely
not be unremembered by us all. Once more, my
trusty comrades, I thank you, every man of you.
As for thee, lady,” he continued, turning to Atalanta,
“while all have played their part, yet the
glory of the hunt is thine. But for thy sure hand
and eye the beast might yet be lurking in the forest.
Wherefore, as a token of our gratitude, I will give
to thee the boar’s head as a trophy to do with as
thou wilt.”</p>

<p>At his words a murmur of applause went round
the ring of them that listened. Only the voices of
Toxeus and Plexippus were not heard, for they
were mad with jealousy and wrath, and as soon as
there was silence they spoke.</p>

<p>“By what right,” asked Toxeus, “shall one bear
off the trophy of a hunt in which each one of us
has played his part?”</p>

<p>The insolence of his words and looks roused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
anger of Meleager to boiling-point. All through
the hunt the brothers had shown scant courtesy to
Atalanta, and now their rudeness was past bearing.</p>

<p>“By the same right as the best man bears off the
prize in any contest,” he answered quietly, though
he was pale with rage.</p>

<p>“Happy is that one who has first won the heart
of the judge, then,” said Plexippus with a sneer, as
he looked at Atalanta.</p>

<p>By the truth and the falsehood of his words Meleager
was maddened past all bearing. Scarce
knowing what he did, he sprang upon him, and before
anyone knew what he was about, he had buried
his hunting-knife in the heart of Plexippus. When
Toxeus saw his brother fall back upon the grass, he
sprang upon Meleager, and for a moment they
swung backwards and forwards, held each in the
other’s deadly grip. But Meleager was the younger
and the stronger of the two, and soon Toxeus too
lay stretched upon the ground beside his brother,
and a cry of horror went through the crowd of those
who stood by. Pale and trembling, Meleager
turned towards them.</p>

<p>“My friends,” he said, “farewell. You shall
look upon my face no more. Whether I slew them
justly or no, the curse of Heaven is upon me, and
I know that night and day the Furies will haunt
my steps, because my hand is red with the blood
of my kinsmen. O fair fields of Calydon, that I
have loved and served all my days, farewell for
ever. Never more shall I look upon you, nor my
home on the steep hill-side, nor the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
queen, my mother; but I must hide my head in
shame far from the haunts of men. As for thee,
lady,” he said, turning to Atalanta, “their taunt
was false, yet true. Right honorably didst thou
win the trophy, as all these here will testify;” and
he pointed to the hunters standing round. “Yet
my soul leapt with joy when I found that into
thine hand and none other’s I might give the prize
of the hunt. Wherefore, think kindly on my memory,
lady, when I am far away, for a brave man’s
heart is in thy keeping. Farewell.”</p>

<p>And he turned and went away by the forest-path.
So surprised were all the company that no
man moved hand or foot to stop him. The first
to speak was Atalanta. “Comrades,” she said, “do
you bear home the dead and break the news as
gently as may be to the queen, and I will follow
him, if perchance I can comfort him, for the hand
of Heaven is heavy upon him.”</p>

<p>The rumor had reached the city that the boar
had been killed, but not without loss among the
gallant band that had gone out against him, and
with a heavy heart Althæa was waiting to know
who it was that had fallen. In time she saw them
returning home, and in their midst four litters carried
on the shoulders of some. When she saw them,
her heart stood still with fear, and as they came up
and laid down the litters before the doorway she
was as one turned to marble, and moved neither
hand nor foot. When Œneus the king saw her,
he took her gently by the hand. “Come within,
lady,” he said; “the hunting of the boar has cost
us dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! tell me the worst at once,” she cried. “I
can bear it better so. The suspense is maddening
me.”</p>

<p>“Two of those who lie before thee are strangers
who have given themselves for us,” he said. “One
of them is sore wounded, and the other is gone
beyond recovery. The other two, Althæa, are very
near and dear to us—Toxeus and Plexippus, thy
brothers.”</p>

<p>And he pointed to two of the bodies which lay
side by side before her, with their faces covered.
With a cry she drew back the coverings, and gazed
upon the faces that she loved so well. As she
looked, she saw the wounds that had killed them,
and she knew now that it was no wild beast that
had slain them, but the hand of man. Drawing herself
up to her full height, she looked round on those
who stood by, and the gleam of her eyes was terrible
to see. “Deceive me no more,” she said, “but
tell me how these two came to fall by the hand of
man.”</p>

<p>“Lady,” said Œneus, “they sought a quarrel
with one of our company, and in anger he slew
them both.”</p>

<p>For a moment she was silent, then in a low voice,
yet one that all could hear, she spoke. “My curse
be upon him, whosoe’er he be. O Daughters of
Destruction, wingless Furies, I bid you track his
footsteps night and day. May no roof cover his
head nor any man give him food or drink, but let
him be a vagabond on the face of the earth till just
vengeance overtake him. On thee, Œneus, do I
lay this charge, and on my son Meleager, to avenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the death of these my kinsmen, who have been
foully slain.”</p>

<p>In vain did Œneus try to stop her. She was as
one deaf to his entreaties. When she had finished,
she looked round for Meleager, and when she could
not see him, she cried—“where is my son?”</p>

<p>“Lady,” said Œneus, “even now the wingless
bearers of thy curse are hunting him through the
forest.”</p>

<p>For a moment she swayed to and fro as though
she would fall. “Ye gods, what have I done?” she
muttered.</p>

<p>Then with a cry she turned and rushed through
the doorway, across the deserted palace to her own
chamber, and barring the door behind her, she
took from its hiding-place the brand she had kept
jealously so long. As on the day when the Fates
had come to her, a bright fire was burning on the
hearth, and deep into the heart of it she pushed the
log with both her hands.</p>

<p>“O my son, my son!” she cried; “to think that I
should come to this! But though the flame that
devours thy life burns out my heart within me,
yet must I do it. Thus only can I save thee from
my curse. For the word, once spoken, never dies,
and the Furies, once aroused, sleep never, night
nor day. Wherefore Death alone can give thee
peace, O Meleager, my first-born and my dearest.”</p>

<p>Œneus meanwhile had followed her, and stood
without, asking her to open to him. But she cried
out to him:</p>

<p>“All is well. I beg thee leave me. I would be
alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>So he left her; and she stood watching the flames
slowly eat the wood away, and at last, when the
log fell apart in ashes, she sank down upon the
floor, and with her son’s life hers too went out for
grief.</p>

<p>Meleager meanwhile had gone blindly forward
along the forest track, and from afar Atalanta followed
him. For a time he went onward, straight
as an arrow, never stopping, never turning. But
when his mother’s curse was spoken, faster than
the whirlwind the Furies flew from the realms of
endless night, and came and crouched before his
feet. With a cry he turned aside, and tried to flee
from them, but wherever he looked they were there
before him, and he reeled backward and forward
like a drunken man. But soon his strength seemed
to give way, and he fell forward on the grass, and
Atalanta ran forward and took his head upon her
knee. To her eyes they two were alone in the heart
of the forest, for the foul shapes of the Furies he
alone had seen. But now he lay with his eyes
closed, faint and weak, and she thought that some
time in the hunt he must have strained himself, and
lay dying of some inward hurt that no man could
heal, for on his body she could see not a scratch.
So she sat in the gathering gloom with his head
upon her lap. There was naught else she could
do. At last, when his heart beat so faint that she
thought it had stopped once for all, he opened his
eyes and looked up at her, and when he saw her the
fear and the madness died out of his face, and he
smiled.</p>

<p>“The gods are kind,” he said. Once more he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
closed his eyes, and Atalanta knew that he would
open them never again. Gently she laid him with
his head on the moss-covered roots of a tree, and
sped away to the city to bear the news of his death.
In the darkness of night they bore him through the
forest, and all the people gathered together and
watched from the walls the torchlit procession as it
came slowly up the hill. By the side of his mother
they laid him, and burned above them the torches
of the dead, and the mourners, with heads bowed
in grief, stood around.</p>

<p>Thus did it come to pass that the hunting of the
boar ended in grief for the land of Calydon, and
Atalanta went back to the Arcadian woodlands
with a sore place in her heart for Meleager, who
had died happy because his head was resting on her
knee.</p>

<h3 id="THE_WINNING_OF_ATALANTA">THE WINNING OF ATALANTA</h3>

<p class="author">By Elsie Finnimore Buckley</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once upon a time there ruled in Arcadian
Tegea a proud-hearted king named Schœnus.
A tamer of horses was he, and a man mighty in the
hunt and in battle. Above every other thing he
loved danger and sport and all kinds of manly
exercise. Indeed, these things were the passion of
his life, and he despised all womenkind because they
could take no part nor lot in them. And he wedded
Clymene, a fair princess of a royal house, because
he wished to raise up noble sons in his halls, who
should ride and hunt with him, and carry on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
name when he was dead. On his wedding-day he
swore a great oath, and called upon all the gods to
witness it.</p>

<p>“Never,” he swore in his pride, “shall a maid
child live in my halls. If a maid is born to me, she
shall die ere her eyes see the light, and the honor
of my house shall rest upon my sons alone.”</p>

<p>For many a long year no child was born to him,
and when at last he had hopes of an heir, the babe
that was born was a maid. When he saw the child
his heart was cut in two, and the pride of a father
and the pride of his oath did battle within him for
victory.</p>

<p>The pride of his oath conquered, for he was
afraid to break his word in the face of all his
people. He hardened his heart, and gave orders
that the child should be cast out upon the mountains
to die of hunger and cold. So the babe was
given to a servant, who bore it forth and left it on
the slope of bleak Parthenium.</p>

<p>When Diana, the maiden goddess, saw the child
cast forth to die, she was filled with anger against
Schœnus, and swore that it should live. Wherefore
she sent a she-bear to the place where the child lay,
and softened the heart of the beast, so that she
lifted it gently in her mouth and bore it to the cave
where her own cubs lay hid. There she suckled it
with her own young ones, and tended it night and
day, till it grew strong and could walk, and the
cave rang with its laughter as it played and gambolled
with the young bears. When Diana knew
that the child was old enough to live without its
foster-mother, she sent her nymphs to fetch it away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and when they bore it to her she was well pleased
to find it fair and strong.</p>

<p>“Her name shall be Atalanta,” she said to them.
“She shall dwell on the mountains and in the woods
of Arcadia, and be one of my band with you. A
mighty huntress shall she be, and the swiftest of all
mortals upon earth; and in time she shall return to
her own folk and bring joy and sorrow to their
hearts.”</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Atalanta lived with
the nymphs in the woodlands of Arcadia. They
taught her to run and to hunt, and to shoot with
bow and arrows, till soon the day came when she
could do these things as well as any of their band.
Diana loved her, and delighted to do her honor;
and when the land of Calydon cried to her for
mercy, because of the boar she had sent to ravage
it in her wrath, she decreed that none but Atalanta
should have the glory of that hunt. The tale of how
she came to Calydon, and how the boar was slain
at last through her, I have told you before; and of
how death came to Meleager, because he loved her,
and would not let any man insult her while he stood
idly by. By the fame of that hunt her name was
carried far and wide through Greece, so that when
she came to the funeral games of Pelias there was
no need to ask who she was. She ran in the foot race
against the swiftest in the land, and won the prize
so easily that when she reached the goal the first
man had scarce passed the turning-point, though he
was no sluggard to make a mock of. When the
games were over, she went back to Arcadia without
a tear or a sigh, but her face and her memory lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in the heart of many a man whose very name she
had not known.</p>

<p>The tale of how Atalanta went back to her own
folk, and of how she was wooed and won, is as
follows:</p>

<p>One day, when King Schœnus held a great hunt
in the forest on the edge of his domain, it chanced
that Atalanta had come to those parts; and when
she heard the blare of the bugles and the barking of
the hounds her heart leapt with joy. Full often had
she joined in a hunt on the uplands of Arcadia, and
run with the hounds.</p>

<p>So now she joined in the chase as the stag broke
loose from cover, and her white feet flashed in the
sunlight as she followed the hounds across the open
moorland. King Schœnus, when he saw her, was
glad.</p>

<p>“It is Atalanta, the maiden huntress,” he cried.
“See that she be treated with due courtesy, for she
is the only woman on earth who is fit to look a man
in the face.”</p>

<p>And he rode eagerly after her. But the best
horse in all that company was no match for Atalanta.
Far ahead of them all she shot, like an arrow
from the bow, and when at last the stag turned at
bay in a pool, she was the first to reach him. When
the rest had come up, and the huntsman had slain
the stag, the king turned to her.</p>

<p>“Atalanta,” he said, “the trophy of this chase is
thine, and my huntsman shall bear the head of the
stag whithersoever thou shalt bid him. In token
of our esteem, I beg thee to accept this ring. When
thou lookest upon it, think kindly of an old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
whose heart is lonely, and who would fain have a
daughter like thee.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew off a gold ring from his
finger and held it towards her; the tears stood in his
eyes and his hand shook as he looked on her fair
young form, and remembered the babe he had cast
out on the mountains to die. If she had lived she
would have been at an age with Atalanta, and perchance
as fair and as strong as she; and his heart
was bitter against himself for the folly of his oath.</p>

<p>When Atalanta heard his words, she had a mind
at first to refuse his gift. Many a man before had
offered her gifts, and she had refused them every
one; for she had no wish to be beholden to any man.
But when she saw the eyes of the old king dim with
tears, and how his hand shook as he held out the
ring, her heart was softened, and yearned with a
strange yearning towards him. Coming forward,
she knelt at his feet and took the ring, and held
his hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>“May the gods grant the prayer of thy heart,
sire,” she said, “and give thee a daughter like unto
me, but fairer and more wise than I!”</p>

<p>As he looked down on the hand that held his own
the old king trembled more violently than before,
for above the wrist was a birthmark like the birthmark
above the wrist of the babe he had cast forth
to die. And he knew that he made no mistake, for
that mark had lived in his mind as though it had
been branded with red-hot steel.</p>

<p>“Atalanta,” he said, “the gods have heard thy
prayer. This is not the first time thy fingers have
closed about mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“What meanest thou, sire?” she asked.</p>

<p>“As many years ago as the span of thy young
life,” he said, “I held in my arms a new-born babe,
the child that the gods had given me, and its little
hand with a birthmark above the wrist closed about
my finger trustfully. But because of my foolish
pride I hardened my heart. I cast away the gift of
the gods and sent the child to die upon the mountains.
But the birthmark on its wrist was branded
on my brain so that I could not forget it. Never
till this day have I seen that mark again, and now I
see it on thy wrist, my child.”</p>

<p>He bowed his head as he spoke, and the tears
from his eyes fell upon her hand, which lay in his
as she knelt before him.</p>

<p>“Oh, my father!” she cried, and bent forward and
kissed his hand.</p>

<p>When he found that she did not turn from him,
though she knew what he had done, he was more
deeply moved than before. “Atalanta,” he said,
“when I cast thee forth to die, I gave back to the
gods the life they had given me, and now I have no
right to claim it again. Yet would thy presence be
as sunshine in my halls if thou wert to come back
to me, my child.”</p>

<p>Thus did the call come to Atalanta to return to
her own folk, and the choice lay before her. On the
one side was her free life in the forest, with Diana
and her nymphs, the hunt, the fresh air, and all the
things that she loved; on the other was life within
the walls of a city, and the need to bow her head to
the customs and the ways of men. Her heart misgave
her when she thought of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“My lord,” she said, “will a young lion step into
the cage of his own free will, think you?”</p>

<p>The old king bowed his head at her words.
“Alas! what other answer could I look for?” he
said. “I thank the gods that they have shown me
thy fair face this day. Perchance, when we hunt
again in these parts, thou wilt join us for love of
the chase. Till then, my child, farewell.”</p>

<p>With trembling hands he raised her from her
knees, and kissed her on the forehead. Then he
signed to his men to lead forward his horse, and
mounted and rode sadly home through the forest
with his company. When they had gone, she sighed,
and turned and went upon her way. But her eyes
were blind and her ears were deaf to the sights and
sounds she loved so well, and that night she tossed
restlessly upon her couch of moss. For before her
eyes was the figure of an old man bowed with sorrow,
and in her ear his voice pleaded, trembling
with longing and love.</p>

<p>In the early dawn she rose up from her couch,
and bathed in a stream close by, and gathered up
her shining hair in a coil about her head. Then she
put on her sandals and a fresh white tunic, slung
her quiver about her shoulders, and bow in hand
went forth through the forest. Looking neither to
the right nor to the left, she went on her way till she
came to the white road that led to the city. Then
she turned and looked back at the forest.</p>

<p>“Dear trees and woods,” she said, “farewell, and
ye nymphs that dwell in the streams and dance on
the green sward of the mountains. When I have
trodden the white road and gone up to the city, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
can live with you no more. As for thee, great
Diana, who saved me in the beginning, I will be thy
servant for ever, and dwell a maiden all my days,
and a lover of the hunt.” So saying she stepped out
bravely on the white highway, and went up into the
city, till she came to the gate of the palace. When
she had entered the hall, she stopped and looked
about her. At first all seemed silent and deserted
for the folk had gone their several ways for the
work of the day; but at length she spied an old man
sitting on a carved chair in one of the alcoves between
the pillars. It was the king, her father. He
sat with his head upon his hand and his eyes downcast
upon the floor, and his face was sad and full of
longing. And she went and knelt at his feet. The
old man gazed for a moment in her face, as though
he did not see her; then he started from his chair
and laid his hand upon her shoulder. “Atalanta!”
he cried.</p>

<p>“My father,” she said, “I have come back to
thee.”</p>

<p>Then he gathered her up in his arms. “Oh, my
child, my child!” he said. “The gods are kind
beyond my desert.”</p>

<p>“Thy voice cried out to me in the night-time,”
she said, “and I could not shut my heart to thy
pleading. The call of the free earth was strong,
but the call of my blood was stronger.”</p>

<p>Thus did Atalanta come back to her own folk,
and bring joy to the heart of her father and the
mother who had never held her in her arms. A
great feast was held in the palace in her honor, and
through all the city the people rejoiced because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
her. Suitors flocked from far and wide to seek her
hand in marriage. But she treated them one and all
with scorn, and vowed that she would never wed.
At first her father smiled upon her, and looked on
her refusal to wed as the sign of a noble nature,
that was not to be won for the asking of the first
chance-comers. So he gathered about him the
noblest princes in the land in the hope that among
them all there would be one who could win her
heart. But the months passed by, and still she
vowed that she would never wed. All her delight
was in running and hunting, and to ride by her
father’s side. At length the king grew anxious.</p>

<p>“Surely, my child,” he said, “among all these
princes there is one whom thou couldst love?”</p>

<p>“I shall never love any man but thee, my father,”
she replied.</p>

<p>Nothing that he could say would persuade her to
go back from her resolve. But still he reasoned
with her night and day, till at length she grew so
wearied of the matter that she bethought of a plan
that would rid her of all her suitors.</p>

<p>“My father,” she said, “I will wed any man who
shall ask for my hand, if he will fulfill one condition.”</p>

<p>“My child,” cried her father, “I knew that in the
end thou wouldst listen to reason. Tell me thy
condition, that I may spread it abroad among those
who are suing for thy hand.”</p>

<p>“Tell them,” she said, “that I will wed the first
man among them who will run a race with me. If
he win, I will be his bride, but if he lose, he must
die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The king’s face fell when he heard her words.
“Surely thou speakest in mockery, Atalanta,” he
said. “No man in all the world can run as swiftly
as thou canst, and they know it. Thou wilt drive
thy suitors from thee; or if any be foolhardy enough
to run with thee, they will run to a certain death.”</p>

<p>“No man will run to a certain death, my father,”
she answered. “When they know that to sigh for
me is to sigh for death, they will go back to their
own folk, and I shall be troubled with suitors no
more.”</p>

<p>So he published abroad among the suitors the
condition she had made. When they heard it there
was great consternation among them, and they
consulted together as to what they should do, and
some sent a deputation to her to find out the meaning
of her words.</p>

<p>“Lady,” they asked, “when thou speakest of
death thou speakest perchance in parables. Those
who run in the race with thee and are outstripped
must give up all hope of thee, and look upon thy
face no more. And this would be death indeed to
them that love thee.”</p>

<p>But she laughed in their faces. “He who courts
death may race with me at daybreak, and at sunset
he shall drink the poison-cup without fail, and
look neither on my face again nor the face of any
living thing. Have I spoken plainly now?”</p>

<p>The next day there was great confusion in the
halls of King Schœnus. There was shouting and
bustling, and attendants ran this way and that.
Chariots clattered through the gateway and drew
up in the court, and baggage was piled high behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the horses. And Atalanta laughed aloud at the
success of her scheme; for suitor after suitor came
and kissed her hand and bade her farewell.</p>

<p>That night the gathering about the board was
scantier than it had been for many a long day. Yet
a few of the suitors remained, and seemed in no
haste to be gone.</p>

<p>“They are waiting for thee to fulfil thy condition,”
said the king.</p>

<p>Then Atalanta herself went and pleaded with
them.</p>

<p>But they replied, “Lady, thou hast given the condition
of thy marrying, and we are waiting to fulfil
it.”</p>

<p>Thus was she forced to keep her word, and the
lists were made ready for the race, and the lots were
cast among the suitors as to which of them should
be the first to run against her. In the early morning,
before the sun was strong, the race was run,
and all the city crowded to the course to watch it.
The man ran well and bravely, but his speed was
as child’s play to Atalanta. She put forth her
strength like a greyhound that is content to run
for a while before the horses, but when he scents
a hare, can leave them far behind. Even so did
Atalanta run, and came in cool and fresh at the
goal, whilst her rival ran in hot and panting behind
her.</p>

<p>Thus did it come to pass that the first man drank
the poison cup because of his love for Atalanta.
With a smiling face did he drink it, as a man drinks
at a feast.</p>

<p>And now a time of darkness and mourning fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
upon the land, and many a day in the year the city
was hung with black for the sake of some noble
suitor who had chosen death rather than life without
Atalanta. And Atalanta’s heart was sore
within her, because of the rash condition she had
made in her ignorance. When she would fain have
recalled her words it was too late, for the suitors
bound her to her promise.</p>

<p>“Either give thyself of thine own free will to
one of us, or else let us take our chance of winning
thee or death,” they said.</p>

<p>And she was forced to run with them. For in
her heart she knew that even death was happier
for a man than to win her without her love.</p>

<p>Thus were the words of Diana fulfilled when she
said, “In time she shall return to her own folk, and
bring joy and sorrow to their hearts.”</p>

<p>One day it chanced that a stranger came to the
city on a morning that a race was to be run. The
night before he had slept in a village near by, and
the people had told him the tale of Atalanta, and
how on the morrow another suitor was to run to his
death. But he scoffed at their words.</p>

<p>“No man would run to certain death,” he said,
“were the maid as fair as Venus.”</p>

<p>“Go and see for thyself,” they replied. “Soon
we shall hear that thou too wilt run in the race.”</p>

<p>“Never,” he said; “no woman can cheat my life
from me.”</p>

<p>But they shook their heads unconvinced. “Many
before thee have spoken likewise,” said they, “and
yet they have run.”</p>

<p>“If I run, I will run to win,” he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can a snail outstrip a deer?” they asked.</p>

<p>“It might so chance,” said he.</p>

<p>“Thou art mad,” they cried.</p>

<p>“Better to be mad on earth than sane in Hades,”
he replied.</p>

<p>But they shook their heads the more, and tapped
wisely with their fingers on their foreheads, to show
that he was mad and spoke at random.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he said, with a laugh, “we shall see
what we shall see.”</p>

<p>The next morning he set forth early for the city,
and, mingling with the crowd, he made his way to
the race-course, and found for himself a place
where he could watch the whole sight with ease.
The race was run, and ended as it always ended;
and once again the city was hung with black. But
in the mind of the stranger an image remained
which had not been there before—the image of a
maid whose white feet flashed in the sunlight and
her tunic swung to and fro as a flag swings in the
breeze.</p>

<p>“Great Hercules!” he thought within himself, “to
run shoulder to shoulder with her for a moment,
even in a race for death, might be worth the while
after all. I will make myself known at the palace,
and see what the gods will give me.”</p>

<p>For some days he lay hid in the city, till he
thought the time was ripe for him to go up to
the palace of the king. Then he went for a walk
along the highway, and when he was covered with
dust and grime, he returned to the city and made
his way at once to the palace.</p>

<p>When Atalanta saw a stranger at the board her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
heart sank within her, and she kept her eyes turned
away, as though she had not seen him, for she made
sure that he too had come to run in the race with
her. It chanced that night that the company was
scanty, and no man talked in private to his neighbor,
but the conversation leapt from one end of
the board to the other, as each one took his share in
it and said his say. The stranger, too, took his
part with the rest of them, in nowise abashed; and
so shrewd were his words, and so full of wit, that
soon he had a smile upon the face of each one at
the table. For many a long day the talk had not
been so merry nor the laughter so loud at the table
of King Schœnus. Atalanta, too, forgot her constraint,
and talked and laughed freely with the
stranger; and he answered her back, as though it
had been man to man, and showed no more deference
to her than to the others of the company.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, the king approached
the stranger, and Atalanta stood beside him.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the king, “thy name and thy country
are still hid from us, but we are grateful for thy
coming, and would be fain for thee to stay as long
as it shall please thee.”</p>

<p>“I thank thee, sire,” said the stranger, “but I am
bound by a strange vow. I may not reveal my
name, nor accept hospitality for more than one
night from any man, till I come to a house where
none other than the king’s daughter shall promise
me her hand in marriage. From the tales I have
heard in the neighboring country, I have learnt
that I may not hope to end my vow beneath this
roof—though indeed,” he said, turning to Atalanta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
“I would fain press my suit if there were any
chance of success.”</p>

<p>But Atalanta threw back her head at his words.
“Thou hast doubtless heard the condition,” she
said, “by the fulfilment of which alone a man may
win my hand.”</p>

<p>“Alas, sir!” said the king, “I would press no
man to try his luck in that venture.”</p>

<p>“Since that is so,” said the stranger, “I will go
forth once more upon my journey at break of day,
and see what luck the gods will give me. I thank
thee for thy kindly hospitality this night, and beg
thee to excuse me. I have travelled far, and would
fain rest now, as I must go a long distance ere I
can rest again.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he took his leave of King Schœnus
and his daughter. But she, for all her pride, could
not forget the man who seemed to bid her farewell
with so light a heart.</p>

<p>It was her custom to rise early in the morning,
before the rest of the household was stirring, and
to go forth alone into the woods; and it was the lot
of one of the slaves to rouse himself betimes to give
her food ere she went, so that when she appeared,
as was her wont, he thought nothing of it. The
stranger had risen even earlier than she, and the
slave was waiting upon him.</p>

<p>“Good-morrow, sir,” she said. “It is not often I
have a companion when I break my fast.” Then
she turned to the slave, “Thou mayest get thee
back to thy bed,” she said, “and sleep out thy sleep
in peace. I will see to the wants of our guest and
speed him on his way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon Atalanta sat down at the board beside
the stranger, and they fell to with all the appetite
of youth and health; and as they ate they laughed
and joked, and talked of strange lands they both
had seen and adventures that had befallen them.
In the space of one-half hour they were as good
friends as though they had known each other all
their lives.</p>

<p>When they had finished their meal the stranger
rose. “I must bid thee farewell, lady,” he said.</p>

<p>“Nay, not yet,” she replied; “I will set thee on
thy way, and show thee a road through the forest
that will bring thee to the city thou seekest. I
know every track and path as well as the wild deer
know them.”</p>

<p>He tried to dissuade her, but she would not
listen, and led him out from the palace by a side
gate, which she unbarred with her own hands.
Down through the sleeping streets they went, where
the shadows of the houses lay long upon the ground,
and out across the open downs into the shade of
the forest. At length they came to a broad track
that crossed the path they were in, and Atalanta
stopped short and pointed to the right.</p>

<p>“From here,” she said, “thou canst not miss thy
way. Follow the track till it lead thee to the highroad,
and when thou strikest the highroad, turn
to the left, and thou wilt come to the city thou
seekest.”</p>

<p>Then she held out her hand to him. “I must
bid thee farewell,” she said, “and good luck to the
ending of thy vow.”</p>

<p>“Lady,” he said, and took her hand in his, “if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
thou wilt, thou canst release me now from my
vow.”</p>

<p>But she drew her hand away sharply and tossed
back her head. “Many kings have daughters besides
King Schœnus,” she said, “and any one of
them could release thee from thy vow as well as I.”</p>

<p>“Atalanta,” he said, “no king’s daughter save
thee shall ever release me from my vow. From
the first moment that I saw thee I loved thee.”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest how thou mayest win me. Art
thou willing to run in the race?”</p>

<p>“Much good will my love do me if I had to drink
the poison cup. Nay, nay,” he said; “I love thee
too well to put my death at thy door. When I
have some chance of winning the race, I will come
back and claim thee. In the meantime, lady, farewell.”</p>

<p>And, bowing to her, he turned and went his way,
without so much as looking back at her, as she
stood trembling with astonishment and anger.</p>

<p>Day after day passed by, and he came not. “He
is a man of his word,” she thought at last.
“Till he has some chance of winning he will not
come back. And he is no fool. He knows he can
never run as I can run. He will never come
back.”</p>

<p>Yet for all this she watched for him. When she
went forth into the road, or into the forest, she
looked for his form at every turn of the way. The
weeks and months passed by, and still he returned
not; winter came and went, and once again the dewdrops
shone in the summer sunlight as Atalanta
walked in the forest at break of day. When by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
chance she raised her eyes, there at the parting
of the ways, he stood, as though in answer to her
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I have come back, lady,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried from her heart, “I am glad thou
hast come back.”</p>

<p>Then he bent and kissed her hand. So once
more they walked in silence side by side along the
path they had walked before. As they drew near
to the edge of the forest, Atalanta was the first to
speak.</p>

<p>“And thy vow,” she asked—“hast thou found
release from it?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” he answered. “I am come back to
run the race, that I may win release.”</p>

<p>Once again the spirit of perversity came upon
her. “Where hast thou learnt to run like the
wind?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I have not learnt to run like the wind,” he replied.
“I have learnt something better than that.”</p>

<p>“Few things are better in a race than swiftness,”
she said.</p>

<p>“True,” he answered; “yet I have found the one
thing better.”</p>

<p>“What is this strange thing?” she asked.</p>

<p>“When we have run the race, thou wilt know,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I have grown no sluggard,” she said, with a toss
of her head, as though to warn him that her speed
was not a thing to be despised. So they came to
the palace, and from the lowest to the highest the
inmates greeted the stranger with joy. For he had
won the hearts of them all by his wit and his genial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
smile. But they sighed when they heard that he
too had come to run in the fatal race.</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the old king, shaking his head, “I
had rather not have looked upon thy face again
than see thee back on such an errand.”</p>

<p>The young man laughed. “He who runs with
a fair hope of winning runs swiftly,” he said. “The
others were dragged down by the shackles of their
own despair.”</p>

<p>“Thou dost not know my daughter,” said the
king.</p>

<p>“Mayhap I know her better than thou thinkest,
and better than thou knowest her thyself,” said
the stranger.</p>

<p>No arguments or entreaties would turn him from
his purpose. “I must win release from my vow,”
he said. “I cannot live all my life a nameless wanderer.
Yet will I not wed any woman I love not,
for the sake of my release. Atalanta alone can
save me, for I love none other.”</p>

<p>So the lists once again were prepared, and the
course made smooth for the race. The folk were
gathered together round the course, and Atalanta
and the stranger stood ready and waiting for the
word to be given. She had made it a condition of
the race that her rivals should have a good start of
her, and she stood with her eyes upon the stranger’s
back, as he waited many paces before her. All too
soon the word was given, and he sprang forward
from his place, like a dog which has been straining
at his leash springs forward when the hook is unloosed.
And Atalanta, too, sprang forward; but
whereas the man ran like a hunted thing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
strains every muscle to save its life, she ran with the
swinging grace of a wild deer that, far away from
the hunters and hounds, crosses the springing turf
of the lonely moor, fearless and proud, as he throws
back his antlers in the breeze. Thus did Atalanta
run, as though she had no thought of the race, or
of the man who ran for his life. Yet, though she
seemed to make no effort, she gained upon her rival
at every step, and now she was running close behind
him, and now she was almost shoulder to shoulder,
and out of the corner of his eye he could see the
gleam of her tunic. Then for a moment he slackened
his pace, and it seemed that she would pass
him, and on every side the people shouted out to
him, “Run, run! Faster, faster! She will pass
thee.”</p>

<p>But he put his hand into the opening of his tunic,
and drew forth something from his breast. Then
his hand swung up above his head, and from it there
flashed a dazzling fiery apple. Up and down
through the air it flashed like a meteor, and rolled
along the grass, till it stopped far away in the
center of the course, and lay shining like a jewel in
the rays of the sun. Every eye was turned from
the race to watch its gleaming flight, and Atalanta
stopped short and watched it too. When she saw
it stop still in the middle of the course, flashing
and sparkling in the grass, a great desire sprang
up in her heart to have it—a desire that she could
not resist. And she darted aside out of the path
of the race and went and picked up the shining
golden apple and put it in the bosom of her tunic.
Meanwhile the stranger had lost no time, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Atalanta came back to the spot she had left, he was
far ahead upon the course, and she had to run
with a will if she wished to overtake him. But
once again she gained upon him, and the space
between them grew less and less, till they were
running well nigh shoulder to shoulder. And once
again he saw the gleam of her tunic beside him; and
again he slackened his speed for a moment, and
sent a second gleaming apple into the air. Once
more the desire sprang up in Atalanta’s heart, and,
leaving the course, she picked up the second apple
and put it in the bosom of her tunic beside the
first. By the time she had returned to the path
the stranger had rounded the turning-point and was
well on his way towards the goal, and she put
forth all her strength to overtake him. But the
ease of her running was gone. She ran as one who
runs bearing a burden, yet she would not cast away
the golden apples in her bosom; for though they
hampered her, she gained upon her rival, and for
the third time they were running almost shoulder
to shoulder. And again, the third time, the same
thing happened, and Atalanta left the course to
pick up the shining fruit. This time when she
returned to her place the stranger was close upon
the goal, and all around the people were shouting
and waving their hands. With all the strength
that was left in her she made a great spurt to overtake
him. If she would cast away the golden
apples, she might yet win the race; but the same
mad desire which had spurred her to pick them up
forbade her now to let them go. As she ran they
seemed to grow heavier and heavier in her bosom;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
yet she struggled and panted on, and step by step
did she gain upon him, though her eyes were darkened
to all but his form and the goal ahead. On
every side the people shouted louder than before,
for they knew not now which of them would win.
As they drew near to the goal they were again almost
shoulder to shoulder, and the stranger saw
once more the flash of Atalanta’s tunic beside him,
while there were yet some paces to run. Then he
gave a great spurt forward, and leapt away from
her side. She tried to do likewise, but her strength
was gone. She had made her last effort before.
Thus did it come to pass that the stranger ran in
first to the goal, and, running close upon his heels,
Atalanta fell breathless into his arms as he turned
to catch her. She had run twice as far as he, but
what matter if he had not outsped her. He had
won the race. The tears shone in her eyes, but he
knew they were not tears of grief; and in the face
of all the people he kissed her.</p>

<p>Thus was Atalanta, the swiftest of all mortals,
beaten in the race by the stranger, and learnt
from his lips what it was that he had found on
his travels that had made speed of no avail in the
race.</p>

<p>For after they had come back to the city, surrounded
by the joyous folk, and had passed hand
in hand beneath the gateway; after he had revealed
to them all that he was Milanion, the son of Amphidamas,
and the old king had fallen on his neck
and given him his blessing, because he proved to be
the son of his own boyhood’s friend, and the man of
all others he would have chosen for his son-in-law—after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
all this, when the speeches and the merrymaking
were over, they two walked on the moonlit
court of the palace.</p>

<p>“Tell me their secret,” she said, and held out the
fruit in her hands.</p>

<p>“Their secret lies in thy heart, Atalanta,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“What meanest thou?” she asked.</p>

<p>“When I left thee at the parting of the ways,”
he said, “I travelled many a weary league by land,
and on the road I passed many a shrine of Venus.
But I never passed them by without lifting up my
hands in prayer to the goddess, for I knew that
she could help me if she would, and I knew that
to them that love truly she is ever kind in the end.
But I wandered till I was footsore and weary, and
yet I had no sign. At length I came to the seashore,
and took ship for the pleasant isle of Cyprus,
which is her home. There at last she came to me,
walking on the waves of the sea. As I lay on the
shore in the night-time, I saw her as a great light
afar, and she drew near to me with the foam playing
white about her feet. In her hand she bore
three shining golden apples.</p>

<p>“‘Fear not, Milanion,’ she said; ‘I have heard
the cry of thy heart. Here are three apples from
mine own apple-tree. If she whom thou lovest
loves thee in return, she cannot resist the spell of
their golden brightness. When thou runnest
against her, cast them one by one into the middle
of the course. If she love thee she will turn aside
to pick them up. For her they will be heavy as
the gold they seem made of. For thee they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
be light as the fruit whose form they wear. Farewell
and good luck to thy race.’</p>

<p>“Thereupon darkness came over my eyes, and I
could find no words to thank her. When I awoke
I thought it had been a dream, but lo! by my side
upon the sand lay the apples, shining in the sunlight.”</p>

<p>“And thy vow?” asked Atalanta. “How camest
thou to make such a vow?”</p>

<p>He laughed at her words. “Long ago in my
father’s house I heard of thee and how thou couldst
cast such a spell upon the hearts of men that for
thy sake they would fling away their lives. And
a great desire came upon me to see this thing for
myself, for I could scarce believe it. So I set forth
alone to find thee, and hid my name from all men
as I journeyed, for thus could I be more free to act
as seemed best in mine own eyes. And I saw thee
run in a race, and that glimpse was enough to
tell me that I too one day must run with thee. Yet
was I more wary than my rivals. I knew that to
come as a suitor was the way to turn thy heart to
stone. Wherefore I pretended to be bound by a
vow, which would bring me as a passing stranger
before thee. Deep in my heart I felt that when a
man desires one thing on earth above every other—when
he loves that thing better than life itself, he
is likely to win it in the end, if he walk patiently
step by step in faith. He will win that thing, or
death, in his struggle for it; and he is content that
so it should be.”</p>

<h3 id="TURNING_EVERYTHING_INTO_GOLD">TURNING EVERYTHING INTO GOLD</h3>

<p class="author">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once upon a time, there lived a very rich
man, and a king besides, whose name was
Midas; and he had a little daughter, whom nobody
but myself ever heard of, and whose name I either
never knew, or have entirely forgotten. So, because
I love odd names for little girls, I choose to
call her Marygold.</p>

<p>This King Midas was fonder of gold than of
anything else in the world. He valued his
royal crown chiefly because it was composed of
that precious metal. If he loved anything better,
or half so well, it was the one little maiden who
played so merrily around her father’s footstool.
But the more Midas loved his daughter, the more
did he desire and seek for wealth. He thought,
foolish man! that the best thing he could possibly
do for this dear child would be to bequeath her
the immensest pile of yellow, glistening coin that
had ever been heaped together since the world was
made. Thus, he gave all his thoughts and all his
time to this one purpose. If ever he happened to
gaze for an instant at the gold-tinted clouds of
sunset, he wished that they were real gold, and
that they could be squeezed safely into his strong
box. When little Marygold ran to meet him, with
a bunch of buttercups and dandelions, he used to
say, “Poh, poh, child! If these flowers were as
golden as they look, they would be worth the
plucking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet, in his earlier days, before he was so
entirely possessed of this insane desire for riches,
King Midas had shown a great taste for flowers.
He had planted a garden, in which grew the biggest
and beautifulest and sweetest roses that any
mortal ever saw or smelt. These roses were still
growing in the garden, as large, as lovely, and as
fragrant, as when Midas used to pass whole hours
in gazing at them, and inhaling their perfume.
But now, if he looked at them at all, it was only
to calculate how much the garden would be worth
if each of the innumerable rose petals were a thin
plate of gold. And though he once was fond of
music (in spite of an idle story about his ears,
which were said to resemble those of an ass), the
only music for poor Midas, now, was the chink of
one coin against another.</p>

<p>At length (as people always grow more and
more foolish, unless they take care to grow wiser
and wiser), Midas had got to be so exceedingly
unreasonable that he could scarcely bear to see
or touch any object that was not gold. He made
it his custom, therefore, to pass a large portion of
every day in a dark and dreary apartment, under
ground, at the basement of his palace. It was
here that he kept his wealth. To this dismal hole—for
it was little better than a dungeon—Midas
betook himself whenever he wanted to be particularly
happy. Here, after carefully locking the
door, he would take a bag of gold coin, or a gold
cup as big as a washbowl, or a heavy golden bar,
or a peck-measure of gold-dust, and bring them
from the obscure corners of the room into the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
bright and narrow sunbeam that fell from the dungeon-like
window. He valued the sunbeam for no
other reason but that his treasure would not shine
without its help. And then would he reckon over
the coins in the bag; toss up the bar, and catch it
as it came down; sift the gold-dust through his
fingers; look at the funny image of his own face,
as reflected in the burnished circumference of the
cup; and whisper to himself, “O Midas, rich King
Midas, what a happy man art thou!” But it was
laughable to see how the image of his face kept
grinning at him, out of the polished surface of the
cup. It seemed to be aware of his foolish behavior,
and to have a naughty inclination to make fun
of him.</p>

<p>Midas called himself a happy man, but felt that
he was not yet quite so happy as he might be. The
very tiptop of enjoyment would never be reached,
unless the whole world were to become his treasure-room,
and be filled with yellow metal which should
be all his own.</p>

<p>Now, I need hardly remind such wise little people
as you are, that in the old, old times, when
King Midas was alive, a great many things came
to pass which we should consider wonderful if
they were to happen in our own day and country.
And, on the other hand, a great many things take
place nowadays, which seem not only wonderful
to us, but at which the people of old times would
have stared their eyes out. On the whole, I regard
our own times as the strangest of the two; but,
however that may be, I must go on with my story.</p>

<p>Midas was enjoying himself in his treasure-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
one day, as usual, when he perceived a shadow
fall over the heaps of gold, and, looking suddenly
up, what should he behold but the figure of
a stranger, standing in the bright and narrow sunbeam!
It was a young man, with a cheerful and
ruddy face. Whether it was that the imagination
of King Midas threw a yellow tinge over everything,
or whatever the cause might be, he could
not help fancying that the smile with which the
stranger regarded him had a kind of golden radiance
in it. Certainly, although his figure intercepted
the sunshine, there was now a brighter
gleam upon all the piled-up treasures than before.
Even the remotest corners had their share of it,
and were lighted up, when the stranger smiled, as
with tips of flame and sparkles of fire.</p>

<p>As Midas knew that he had carefully turned the
key in the lock, and that no mortal strength could
possibly break into his treasure-room, he, of course,
concluded that his visitor must be something more
than mortal. It is no matter about telling you who
he was. In those days, when the earth was comparatively
a new affair, it was supposed to be often
the resort of beings endowed with supernatural
power, and who used to interest themselves in the
joys and sorrows of men, women, and children,
half playfully and half seriously. Midas had met
such beings before now, and was not sorry to meet
one of them again. The stranger’s aspect, indeed,
was so good-humored and kindly, if not beneficent,
that it would have been unreasonable to suspect
him of intending any mischief. It was far more
probable that he came to do Midas a favor. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
what could that favor be, unless to multiply his
heaps of treasure?</p>

<p>The stranger gazed about the room; and when
his lustrous smile had glistened upon all the golden
objects that were there, he turned again to Midas.</p>

<p>“You are a wealthy man, friend Midas!” he observed.
“I doubt whether any other four walls,
on earth, contain so much gold as you have contrived
to pile up in this room.”</p>

<p>“I have done pretty well—pretty well,” answered
Midas in a discontented tone. “But,
after all, it is but a trifle, when you consider that
it has taken me my whole life to get it together.
If one could live a thousand years, he might have
time to grow rich!”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the stranger. “Then you
are not satisfied?”</p>

<p>Midas shook his head.</p>

<p>“And pray what would satisfy you?” asked the
stranger. “Merely for the curiosity of the thing,
I should be glad to know.”</p>

<p>Midas paused and meditated. He felt a presentiment
that this stranger, with such a golden
luster in his good-humored smile, had come
hither with both the power and the purpose of
gratifying his utmost wishes. Now, therefore, was
the fortunate moment, when he had but to speak,
and obtain whatever possible, or seemingly impossible
thing, it might come into his head to ask. So
he thought, and thought, and thought, and heaped
up one golden mountain upon another, in his imagination,
without being able to imagine them big
enough. At last, a bright idea occurred to King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Midas. It seemed really as bright as the glistening
metal which he loved so much.</p>

<p>Raising his head, he looked the lustrous stranger
in the face.</p>

<p>“Well, Midas,” observed his visitor, “I see that
you have at length hit upon something that will
satisfy you. Tell me your wish.”</p>

<p>“It is only this,” replied Midas. “I am weary
of collecting my treasures with so much trouble,
and beholding the heap so diminutive, after I have
done my best. I wish everything that I touch to be
changed to gold!”</p>

<p>The stranger’s smile grew so very broad, that it
seemed to fill the room like an outburst of the
sun, gleaming into a shadowy dell, where the
yellow autumnal leaves—for so looked the lumps
and particles of gold—lie strewn in the glow of
light.</p>

<p>“The Golden Touch!” exclaimed he. “You
certainly deserve credit, friend Midas, for striking
out so brilliant a conception. But are you quite
sure that this will satisfy you?”</p>

<p>“How could it fail?” said Midas.</p>

<p>“And will you never regret the possession of
it?”</p>

<p>“What could induce me?” asked Midas. “I ask
nothing else, to render me perfectly happy.”</p>

<p>“Be it as you wish, then,” replied the stranger,
waving his hand in token of farewell. “To-morrow
at sunrise, you will find yourself gifted with
the Golden Touch.”</p>

<p>The figure of the stranger then became exceedingly
bright, and Midas involuntarily closed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
eyes. On opening them again, he beheld only one
yellow sunbeam in the room, and, all around him,
the glistening of the precious metal which he had
spent his life in hoarding up.</p>

<p>Whether Midas slept as usual that night, the
story does not say. Asleep or awake, however, his
mind was probably in the state of a child’s, to whom
a beautiful new plaything has been promised in the
morning. At any rate, day had hardly peeped
over the hills, when King Midas was broad awake,
and, stretching his arms out of bed, began to touch
the objects that were within reach. He was anxious
to prove whether the Golden Touch had really
come, according to the stranger’s promise. So he
laid his finger on a chair by the bedside, and on
various other things, but was grievously disappointed
to perceive that they remained of exactly
the same substance as before. Indeed, he felt very
much afraid that he had only dreamed about the
lustrous stranger, or else that the latter had been
making game of him. And what a miserable affair
would it be, if, after all his hopes, Midas must
content himself with what little gold he could
scrape together by ordinary means, instead of
creating it by a touch!</p>

<p>All this while, it was only the gray of the morning,
with but a streak of brightness along the edge
of the sky, where Midas could not see it. He lay
in a very disconsolate mood, regretting the downfall
of his hopes, and kept growing sadder and sadder,
until the earliest sunbeam shone through the
window, and gilded the ceiling over his head. It
seemed to Midas that this bright yellow sunbeam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was reflected in rather a singular way on the white
covering of the bed. Looking more closely, what
was his astonishment and delight, when he found
that his linen fabric had been transmuted to what
seemed a woven texture of the purest and brightest
gold! The Golden Touch had come to him with
the first sunbeam!</p>

<p>Midas started up, in a kind of joyful frenzy, and
ran about the room, grasping at everything that
happened to be in his way. He seized one of the
bed-posts, and it became immediately a fluted
golden pillar. He pulled aside a window curtain,
in order to admit a clear spectacle of the wonders
which he was performing; and the tassel grew
heavy in his hand—a mass of gold. He took
up a book from the table. At his first touch, it
assumed the appearance of such a splendidly bound
and gilt-edged volume as one often meets with
nowadays; but, on running his fingers through the
leaves, behold! it was a bundle of thin golden plates,
in which all the wisdom of the book had grown illegible.
He hurriedly put on his clothes, and was
enraptured to see himself in a magnificent suit of
gold cloth, which retained its flexibility and softness,
although it burdened him a little with its
weight. He drew out his handkerchief, which little
Marygold had hemmed for him. That was likewise
gold, with the dear child’s neat and pretty
stitches running all along the border, in gold
thread!</p>

<p>Somehow or other, this last transformation did
not quite please King Midas. He would rather
that his little daughter’s handiwork should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
remained just the same as when she climbed his
knee and put it into his hand.</p>

<p>But it was not worth while to vex himself about
a trifle. Midas now took his spectacles from his
pocket, and put them on his nose, in order that he
might see more distinctly what he was about. In
those days, spectacles for common people had not
been invented, but were already worn by kings;
else, how could Midas have had any? To his great
perplexity, however, excellent as the glasses were,
he discovered that he could not possibly see through
them. But this was the most natural thing in the
world; for, on taking them off, the transparent
crystals turned out to be plates of yellow metal,
and, of course, were worthless as spectacles, though
valuable as gold. It struck Midas as rather inconvenient
that, with all his wealth, he could never
again be rich enough to own a pair of serviceable
spectacles.</p>

<p>“It is no great matter, nevertheless,” said he to
himself, very philosophically. “We cannot expect
any great good, without its being accompanied with
some small inconvenience. The Golden Touch is
worth the sacrifice of a pair of spectacles, at least,
if not of one’s very eyesight. My own eyes will
serve for ordinary purposes, and little Marygold
will soon be old enough to read to me.”</p>

<p>Wise King Midas was so exalted by his good
fortune, that the palace seemed not sufficiently
spacious to contain him. He therefore went down
stairs, and smiled, on observing that the balustrade
of the staircase became a bar of burnished gold, as
his hand passed over it, in his descent. He lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the door-latch (it was brass only a moment ago, but
golden when his fingers quitted it), and emerged
into the garden. Here, as it happened, he found a
great number of beautiful roses in full bloom, and
others in all the stages of lovely bud and blossom.
Very delicious was their fragrance in the morning
breeze. Their delicate blush was one of the fairest
sights in the world; so gentle, so modest, and so
full of sweet tranquillity, did these roses seem to be.</p>

<p>But Midas knew a way to make them far more
precious, according to his way of thinking, than
roses had ever been before. So he took great pains
in going from bush to bush, and exercised his magic
touch most indefatigably; until every individual
flower and bud, and even the worms at the heart of
some of them, were changed to gold. By the time
this good work was completed, King Midas was
summoned to breakfast; and as the morning air
had given him an excellent appetite, he made haste
back to the palace.</p>

<p>What was usually a king’s breakfast in the days
of Midas, I really do not know, and cannot stop
now to investigate. To the best of my belief, however,
on this particular morning, the breakfast consisted
of hot cakes, some nice little brook trout,
roasted potatoes, fresh boiled eggs, and coffee, for
King Midas himself, and a bowl of bread and milk
for his daughter Marygold. At all events, this is
a breakfast fit to set before a king; and, whether
he had it or not, King Midas could not have had a
better.</p>

<p>Little Marygold had not yet made her appearance.
Her father ordered her to be called, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
seating himself at table, awaited the child’s coming,
in order to begin his own breakfast. To do
Midas justice, he really loved his daughter, and
loved her so much the more this morning, on
account of the good fortune which had befallen
him. It was not a great while before he heard her
coming along the passageway crying bitterly. This
circumstance surprised him, because Marygold was
one of the cheerfullest little people whom you
would see in a summer’s day, and hardly shed a
thimbleful of tears in a twelvemonth. When Midas
heard her sobs, he determined to put little Marygold
into better spirits, by an agreeable surprise;
so, leaning across the table, he touched his daughter’s
bowl (which was a china one, with pretty
figures all around it), and transmuted it to gleaming
gold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Marygold slowly and disconsolately
opened the door, and showed herself with her apron
at her eyes, still sobbing as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>“How now, my little lady!” cried Midas. “Pray
what is the matter with you, this bright morning?”</p>

<p>Marygold, without taking the apron from her
eyes, held out her hand, in which was one of the
roses which Midas had so recently transmuted.</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” exclaimed her father. “And what
is there in this magnificent golden rose to make
you cry?”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear father!” answered the child, as well
as her sobs would let her; “it is not beautiful, but
the ugliest flower that ever grew! As soon as I
was dressed I ran into the garden to gather some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
roses for you; because I know you like them, and
like them the better when gathered by your little
daughter. But, oh dear, dear me! What do you
think has happened? Such a misfortune! All the
beautiful roses, that smelled so sweetly and had so
many lovely blushes, are blighted and spoilt! They
are grown quite yellow, as you see this one, and
have no longer any fragrance! What can have
been the matter with them?”</p>

<p>“Poh, my dear little girl—pray don’t cry about
it!” said Midas, who was ashamed to confess that
he himself had wrought the change which so greatly
afflicted her. “Sit down and eat your bread and
milk! You will find it easy enough to exchange a
golden rose like that (which will last hundreds of
years) for an ordinary one which would wither in
a day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for such roses as this!” cried Marygold,
tossing it contemptuously away. “It has no
smell, and the hard petals prick my nose!”</p>

<p>The child now sat down to table, but was so occupied
with her grief for the blighted roses that she
did not even notice the wonderful transmutation
of her china bowl. Perhaps this was all the better;
for Marygold was accustomed to take pleasure in
looking at the queer figures, and strange trees and
houses, that were painted on the circumference of
the bowl; and these ornaments were now entirely
lost in the yellow hue of the metal.</p>

<p>Midas, meanwhile, had poured out a cup of
coffee, and, as a matter of course, the coffee-pot,
whatever metal it may have been when he took it
up, was gold when he set it down. He thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to himself, that it was rather an extravagant style
of splendor, in a king of his simple habits, to breakfast
off a service of gold, and began to be puzzled
with the difficulty of keeping his treasures safe.
The cupboard and the kitchen would no longer be
a secure place of deposit for articles so valuable
as golden bowls and coffee-pots.</p>

<p>Amid these thoughts, he lifted a spoonful of
coffee to his lips, and, sipping it, was astonished to
perceive that, the instant his lips touched the liquid,
it became molten gold, and, the next moment hardened
into a lump!</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Midas, rather aghast.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, father?” asked little Marygold,
gazing at him, with the tears still standing in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Nothing, child, nothing!” said Midas. “Eat
your milk, before it gets quite cold.”</p>

<p>He took one of the nice little trouts on his plate,
and, by way of experiment, touched its tail with
his finger. To his horror, it was immediately transmuted
from an admirably fried brook-trout into a
gold-fish, though not one of those gold-fishes which
people often keep in glass globes, as ornaments for
the parlor. No; but it was really a metallic fish,
and looked as if it had been very cunningly made
by the nicest goldsmith in the world. Its little
bones were now golden wires; its fins and tail were
thin plates of gold; and there were the marks of
the fork in it, and all the delicate, frothy appearance
of a nicely fried fish, exactly imitated in metal.
A very pretty piece of work, as you may suppose;
only King Midas, just at that moment, would much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
rather have had a real trout in his dish than this
elaborate and valuable imitation of one.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see,” thought he to himself, “how
I am to get any breakfast!”</p>

<p>He took one of the smoking-hot cakes, and had
scarcely broken it, when, to his cruel mortification,
though, a moment before, it had been of the whitest
wheat, it assumed the yellow hue of Indian meal.
To say the truth, if it had really been a hot Indian
cake, Midas would have prized it a good deal more
than he now did, when its solidity and increased
weight made him too bitterly sensible that it was
gold. Almost in despair, he helped himself to a
boiled egg, which immediately underwent a change
similar to those of the trout and the cake. The
egg, indeed, might have been mistaken for one of
those which the famous goose, in the story-book,
was in the habit of laying; but King Midas was the
only goose that had had anything to do with the
matter.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a quandary!” thought he, leaning
back in his chair, and looking quite enviously at
little Marygold, who was not eating her bread and
milk with great satisfaction. “Such a costly breakfast
before me, and nothing that can be eaten!”</p>

<p>Hoping that, by dint of great dispatch, he might
avoid what he now felt to be a considerable inconvenience,
King Midas next snatched a hot potato,
and attempted to cram it into his mouth, and swallow
it in a hurry. But the Golden Touch was too
nimble for him. He found his mouth full, not of
mealy potato, but of solid metal, which so burnt
his tongue that he roared aloud, and, jumping up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
from the table, began to dance and stamp about
the room both with pain and affright.</p>

<p>“Father, dear father!” cried little Marygold, who
was a very affectionate child, “pray what is the
matter? Have you burnt your mouth?”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear child,” groaned Midas, dolefully, “I
don’t know what is to become of your poor father!”</p>

<p>And, truly, my dear little folks, did you ever
hear of such a pitiable case in all your lives? Here
was literally the richest breakfast that could be set
before a king, and its very richness made it absolutely
good for nothing. The poorest laborer, sitting
down to his crust of bread and cup of water,
was far better off than King Midas, whose delicate
food was really worth its weight in gold. And what
was to be done? Already, at breakfast, Midas was
excessively hungry. Would he be less so by dinner-time?
And how ravenous would be his appetite for
supper, which must undoubtedly consist of the same
sort of indigestible dishes as those now before him!
How many days, think you, would he survive a
continuance of this rich fare?</p>

<p>These reflections so troubled wise King Midas,
that he began to doubt whether, after all, riches
are the one desirable thing in the world, or even
the most desirable. But this was only a passing
thought. So fascinated was Midas with the glitter
of the yellow metal, that he would still have refused
to give up the Golden Touch for so paltry a consideration
as a breakfast. Just imagine what a
price for one meal’s victuals. It would have been
the same as paying millions and millions of money
(and as many millions more as would take forever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to reckon up) for some fried trout, an egg, a
potato, a hot cake, and a cup of coffee!</p>

<p>“It would be quite too dear,” thought Midas.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so great was his hunger, and the
perplexity of his situation, that he again groaned
aloud, and very grievously, too. Our pretty Marygold
could endure it no longer. She sat, a moment,
gazing at her father, and trying, with all the might
of her little wits, to find out what was the matter
with him. Then, with a sweet and sorrowful impulse
to comfort him, she started from her chair,
and, running to Midas, threw her arms affectionately
about his knees. He bent down and kissed
her. He felt that his little daughter’s love was
worth a thousand times more than he had gained
by the Golden Touch.</p>

<p>“My precious, precious Marygold!” cried he.</p>

<p>But Marygold made no answer.</p>

<p>Alas, what had he done? How fatal was the gift
which the stranger bestowed! The moment the
lips of Midas touched Marygold’s forehead, a
change had taken place. Her sweet, rosy face, so
full of affection as it had been, assumed a glittering
yellow color, with yellow tear-drops, congealing
on her cheeks. Her beautiful brown ringlets
took the same tint. Her soft and tender little form
grew hard and inflexible within her father’s encircling
arms. Oh, terrible misfortune! The victim
of his insatiable desire for wealth, little Marygold
was a human child no longer, but a golden statue!</p>

<p>Yes, there she was, with the questioning look of
love, grief, and pity, hardened into her face. It
was the prettiest and most woeful sight that ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
mortal saw. All the features and tokens of Marygold
were there; even the beloved little dimple
remained in her gold chin. But, the more perfect
was the resemblance, the greater was the father’s
agony at beholding this golden image, which was
all that was left him of a daughter. It had been a
favorite phrase of Midas, whenever he felt particularly
fond of the child, to say that she was worth
her weight in gold. And now the phrase had become
literally true. And now, at last, when it
was too late, he felt how infinitely a warm and
tender heart that loved him, exceeded in value all
the wealth that could be piled up betwixt the earth
and sky!</p>

<p>It would be too sad a story, if I were to tell you
how Midas, in the fulness of all his gratified desires,
began to wring his hands and bemoan himself; and
how he could neither bear to look at Marygold, nor
yet to look away from her. Except when his eyes
were fixed on the image, he could not possibly
believe that she was changed to gold. But, stealing
another glance, there was the precious little figure,
with a yellow tear-drop on its yellow cheek, and a
look so piteous and tender, that it seemed as if that
very expression must needs soften the gold and
make it flesh again. This, however, could not be.
So Midas had only to wring his hands, and to wish
that he were the poorest man in the wide world, if
the loss of all his wealth might bring back the
faintest rose-color to his dear child’s face.</p>

<p>While he was in this tumult of despair, he suddenly
beheld a stranger standing near the door.
Midas bent down his head, without speaking; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
he recognized the same figure which had appeared
to him, the day before, in the treasure-room, and
had bestowed on him this disastrous faculty of the
Golden Touch. The stranger’s countenance still
wore a smile, which seemed to shed a yellow luster
all about the room, and gleamed on little Marygold’s
image, and on the other objects that had
been transmuted by the touch of Midas.</p>

<p>“Well, friend Midas,” said the stranger, “pray
how do you succeed with the Golden Touch?”</p>

<p>Midas shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am very miserable,” said he.</p>

<p>“Very miserable, indeed!” exclaimed the stranger.
“And how happens that? Have I not faithfully
kept my promise with you? Have you not everything
that your heart desired?”</p>

<p>“Gold is not everything,” answered Midas.
“And I have lost all that my heart really cared
for.”</p>

<p>“Ah! So you have made a discovery, since yesterday?”
observed the stranger. “Let us see, then.
Which of these two things do you think is really
worth the most—the gift of the Golden Touch, or
one cup of clear cold water?”</p>

<p>“O blessed water!” exclaimed Midas. “It will
never moisten my parched throat again!”</p>

<p>“The Golden Touch,” continued the stranger,
“or a crust of bread?”</p>

<p>“A piece of bread,” answered Midas, “is worth
all the gold on earth!”</p>

<p>“The Golden Touch,” asked the stranger, “or
your own little Marygold, warm, soft and loving
as she was an hour ago?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh my child, my dear child!” cried poor Midas,
wringing his hands. “I would not have given that
one small dimple in her chin for the power of
changing this whole big earth into a solid lump of
gold!”</p>

<p>“You are wiser than you were, King Midas!”
said the stranger, looking seriously at him. “Your
own heart, I perceive, has not been entirely changed
from flesh to gold. Were it so, your case would
indeed be desperate. But you appear to be still
capable of understanding that the commonest
things, such as lie within everybody’s grasp, are
more valuable than the riches which so many mortals
sigh and struggle after. Tell me, now, do you
sincerely desire to rid yourself of this Golden
Touch?”</p>

<p>“It is hateful to me!” replied Midas.</p>

<p>A fly settled on his nose, but immediately fell to
the floor; for it, too, had become gold. Midas
shuddered.</p>

<p>“Go, then,” said the stranger, “and plunge into
the river that glides past the bottom of your garden.
Take likewise a vase of the same water, and
sprinkle it over any object that you may desire to
change back again from gold into its former substance.
If you do this in earnestness and sincerity,
it may possibly repair the mischief which your
avarice has occasioned.”</p>

<p>King Midas bowed low; and when he lifted his
head, the lustrous stranger had vanished.</p>

<p>You will easily believe that Midas lost no time
in snatching up a great earthen pitcher (but, alas
me! it was no longer earthen after he touched it),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and hastening to the river-side. As he scampered
along, and forced his way through the shrubbery, it
was positively marvellous to see how the foliage
turned yellow behind him, as if the autumn had
been there, and nowhere else. On reaching the
river’s brink, he plunged headlong in, without waiting
so much as to pull off his shoes.</p>

<p>“Poof! poof! poof!” snorted King Midas, as his
head emerged out of the water. “Well; this is
really a refreshing bath, and I think it must have
quite washed away the Golden Touch. And now
for filling my pitcher!”</p>

<p>As he dipped the pitcher into the water, it gladdened
his very heart to see it change from gold into
the same good, honest earthen vessel which it had
been before he touched it. He was conscious, also,
of a change within himself. A cold, hard, and
heavy weight seemed to have gone out of his bosom.
No doubt, his heart had been gradually losing its
human substance, and transmuting itself into insensible
metal, but had now softened back again into
flesh. Perceiving a violet, that grew on the bank of
the river, Midas touched it with his finger, and was
overjoyed to find that the delicate flower retained
its purple hue, instead of undergoing a yellow
blight. The curse of the Golden Touch had, therefore,
really been removed from him.</p>

<p>King Midas hastened back to the palace; and, I
suppose, the servants knew not what to make of
it when they saw their royal master so carefully
bringing home an earthen pitcher of water. But
that water, which was to undo all the mischief that
his folly had wrought, was more precious to Midas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
than an ocean of molten gold could have been. The
first thing he did, as you need hardly be told, was
to sprinkle it by handfuls over the golden figure
of little Marygold.</p>

<p>No sooner did it fall on her than you would have
laughed to see how the rosy color came back to
the dear child’s cheek! and how she began to sneeze
and sputter!—and how astonished she was to find
herself dripping wet, and her father still throwing
more water over her!</p>

<p>“Pray do not, dear father!” cried she. “See how
you have wet my nice frock, which I put on only
this morning!”</p>

<p>For Marygold did not know that she had been
a little golden statue; nor could she remember anything
that had happened since the moment when
she ran with outstretched arms to comfort poor
King Midas.</p>

<p>Her father did not think it necessary to tell his
beloved child how very foolish he had been, but
contented himself with showing how much wiser
he had now grown. For this purpose, he led little
Marygold into the garden, where he sprinkled all
the remainder of the water over the rose-bushes,
and with such good effect that above five thousand
roses recovered their beautiful bloom. There were
two circumstances, however, which, as long as he
lived, used to put King Midas in mind of the
Golden Touch. One was, that the sands of the
river sparkled like gold; the other, that little
Marygold’s hair had now a golden tinge, which he
had never observed in it before she had been transmuted
by the effect of his kiss. This change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
hue was really an improvement, and made Marygold’s
hair richer than in her babyhood.</p>

<p>When King Midas had grown quite an old man
and used to trot Marygold’s children on his knee
he was fond of telling them this marvellous story,
pretty much as I have told it to you. And then
would he stroke their glossy ringlets, and tell them
that their hair, likewise, had a rich shade of gold,
which they had inherited from their mother.</p>

<p>“And to tell you the truth, my precious little
folks,” quoth King Midas, diligently trotting the
children all the while, “ever since that morning,
I have hated the very sight of all other gold, save
this!”</p>

<h3 id="THE_POMEGRANATE_SEEDS">THE POMEGRANATE SEEDS</h3>

<p class="author">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</p>

<p class="dropcap">Mother Ceres was exceedingly fond of
her daughter Proserpina, and seldom let her
go alone into the fields. But, just at the time when
my story begins, the good lady was very busy,
because she had the care of the wheat, and the
Indian corn, and the rye and barley, and, in short,
of the crops of every kind, all over the earth; and
as the season had thus far been uncommonly backward,
it was necessary to make the harvest ripen
more speedily than usual. So she put on her turban,
made of poppies (a kind of flower which she
was always noted for wearing), and got into her
car, drawn by a pair of winged dragons, and was
just ready to set off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear mother,” said Proserpina, “I shall be very
lonely while you are away. May I not run down
to the shore, and ask some of the sea-nymphs to
come up out of the waves and play with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, child,” answered Mother Ceres. “The
sea-nymphs are good creatures, and will never lead
you into any harm. But you must take care not
to stray away from them, nor go wandering about
the fields by yourself. Young girls, without their
mothers to take care of them, are very apt to get
into mischief.”</p>

<p>The child promised to be as prudent as if she
were a grown-up woman, and, by the time the
winged dragons had whirled the car out of sight,
she was already on the shore, calling to the sea-nymphs
to come and play with her. They knew
Proserpina’s voice, and were not long in showing
their glistening faces and sea-green hair above
the water, at the bottom of which was their home.
They brought along with them a great many
beautiful shells; and, sitting down on the moist
sand, where the surf wave broke over them, they
busied themselves in making a necklace, which they
hung around Proserpina’s neck. By way of showing
her gratitude, the child besought them to go
with her a little way into the field, so that they
might gather abundance of flowers, with which she
would make each of her kind playmates a wreath.</p>

<p>“Oh no, dear Proserpina,” cried the sea-nymphs;
“we dare not go with you upon the dry land.
We are apt to grow faint, unless at every breath
we can snuff up the salt breeze of the ocean. And
don’t you see how careful we are to let the surf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
wave break over us every moment or two, so as to
keep ourselves comfortably moist? If it were not
for that, we should soon look like bunches of uprooted
sea-weed dried in the sun.”</p>

<p>“It is a great pity,” said Proserpina. “But do
you wait for me here, and I will run and gather
my apron full of flowers, and be back again before
the surf wave has broken ten times over you. I
long to make you some wreaths that shall be as
lovely as this necklace of many-colored shells.”</p>

<p>“We will wait, then,” answered the sea-nymphs.
“But while you are gone, we may as well lie down
on a bank of soft sponge, under the water. The
air to-day is a little too dry for our comfort. But
we will pop up our heads every few minutes to see
if you are coming.”</p>

<p>The young Proserpina ran quickly to a spot
where, only the day before, she had seen a great
many flowers. These, however, were now a little
past their bloom; and wishing to give her friends
the freshest and loveliest blossoms, she strayed
farther into the fields, and found some that made
her scream with delight. Never had she met with
such exquisite flowers before—violets, so large
and fragrant—roses, with so rich and delicate a
blush—such superb hyacinths and such aromatic
pinks—and many others, some of which seemed
to be of new shapes and colors. Two or three
times, moreover, she could not help thinking that
a tuft of most splendid flowers had suddenly
sprouted out of the earth before her very eyes, as
if on purpose to tempt her a few steps farther.
Proserpina’s apron was soon filled and brimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
over with delightful blossoms. She was on the
point of turning back in order to rejoin the sea-nymphs,
and sit with them on the moist sands, all
twining wreaths together. But, a little farther
on, what should she behold? It was a large shrub,
completely covered with the most magnificent
flowers in the world.</p>

<p>“The darlings!” cried Proserpina; and then she
thought to herself, “I was looking at that spot
only a moment ago. How strange it is that I did
not see the flowers!”</p>

<p>The nearer she approached the shrub, the more
attractive it looked, until she came quite close to it;
and then, although its beauty was richer than words
can tell, she hardly knew whether to like it or not.
It bore above a hundred flowers of the most brilliant
hues, and each different from the others, but
all having a kind of resemblance among themselves,
which showed them to be sister blossoms. But there
was a deep, glossy luster on the leaves of the shrub,
and on the petals of the flowers, that made Proserpina
doubt whether they might not be poisonous.
To tell you the truth, foolish as it may seem, she
was half inclined to turn round and run away.</p>

<p>“What a silly child I am!” thought she, taking
courage. “It is really the most beautiful shrub that
ever sprang out of the earth. I will pull it up by
the roots, and carry it home, and plant it in my
mother’s garden.”</p>

<p>Holding up her apron full of flowers with her
left hand, Proserpina seized the large shrub with
the other, and pulled and pulled, but was hardly
able to loosen the soil about its roots. What a deep-rooted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
plant it was! Again the girl pulled with all
her might, and observed that the earth began to
stir and crack to some distance around the stem.
She gave another pull, but relaxed her hold, fancying
that there was a rumbling sound right beneath
her feet. Did the roots extend down into some enchanted
cavern? Then, laughing at herself for so
childish a notion, she made another effort; up came
the shrub, and Proserpina staggered back, holding
the stem triumphantly in her hand, and gazing at
the deep hole which its roots had left in the soil.</p>

<p>Much to her astonishment, this hole kept spreading
wider and wider, and growing deeper and
deeper, until it really seemed to have no bottom;
and all the while, there came a rumbling noise out
of its depths, louder and louder, and nearer and
nearer, and sounding like the tramp of horses’
hoofs and the rattling of wheels. Too much frightened
to run away, she stood straining her eyes into
this wonderful cavity, and soon saw a team of four
sable horses snorting smoke out of their nostrils,
and tearing their way out of the earth with a
splendid golden chariot whirling at their heels.
They leaped out of the bottomless hole, chariot and
all; and there they were, tossing their black manes,
flourishing their black tails, and curvetting with
every one of their hoofs off the ground at once,
close by the spot where Proserpina stood. In the
chariot sat the figure of a man, richly dressed, with
a crown on his head, all flaming with diamonds.
He was of a noble aspect, and rather handsome,
but looked sullen and discontented; and he kept
rubbing his eyes and shading them with his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
as if he did not live enough in the sunshine to be
very fond of its light.</p>

<p>As soon as this personage saw the affrighted
Proserpina, he beckoned her to come a little nearer.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid,” said he, with as cheerful a
smile as he knew how to put on. “Come! Will
not you like to ride a little way with me, in my
beautiful chariot?”</p>

<p>But Proserpina was so alarmed, that she wished
for nothing but to get out of his reach. And no
wonder. The stranger did not look remarkably
good-natured, in spite of his smile; and as for his
voice, its tones were deep and stern, and sounded
as much like the rumbling of an earthquake under
ground as anything else. As is always the case
with children in trouble, Proserpina’s first thought
was to call for her mother.</p>

<p>“Mother, Mother Ceres!” cried she, all in a
tremble. “Come quickly and save me.”</p>

<p>But her voice was too faint for her mother to
hear. Indeed, it is most probable that Ceres was
then a thousand miles off, making the corn grow
in some far-distant country. Nor could it have
availed her poor daughter, even had she been
within hearing; for no sooner did Proserpina begin
to cry out, than the stranger leaped to the
ground, caught the child in his arms, and again
mounting the chariot, shook the reins, and
shouted to the four black horses to set off. They
immediately broke into so swift a gallop that it
seemed rather like flying through the air than
running along the earth. In a moment, Proserpina
lost sight of the pleasant vale of Enna, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
which she had always dwelt. Another instant
and even the summit of Mount Ætna had become
so blue in the distance, that she could scarcely
distinguish it from the smoke that gushed out of
its crater. But still the poor child screamed, and
scattered her apron full of flowers along the way,
and left a long cry trailing behind the chariot;
and many mothers, to whose ears it came, ran
quickly to see if any mischief had befallen their
children. But Mother Ceres was a great way off,
and could not hear the cry.</p>

<p>As they rode on, the stranger did his best to
soothe her.</p>

<p>“Why should you be so frightened, my pretty
child,” said he, trying to soften his rough voice.
“I promise not to do you any harm. What! You
have been gathering flowers? Wait till we come
to my palace, and I will give you a garden full of
prettier flowers than those, all made of pearls, and
diamonds, and rubies. Can you guess who I am?
They call my name Pluto, and I am the king of
diamonds and all other precious stones. Every
atom of the gold and silver that lies under the
earth belongs to me, to say nothing of the copper
and iron, and of the coal-mines, which supply me
with abundance of fuel. Do you see this splendid
crown upon my head? You may have it for a
plaything. Oh, we shall be very good friends, and
you will find me more agreeable than you expect,
when once we get out of this troublesome sunshine.”</p>

<p>“Let me go home!” cried Proserpina—“let me
go home!”</p>

<p>“My home is better than your mother’s,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
answered King Pluto. “It is a palace, all made
of gold, and crystal windows; and because there
is little or no sunshine thereabouts, the apartments
are illuminated with diamond lamps. You
never saw anything half so magnificent as my
throne. If you like, you may sit down on it, and
be my little queen, and I will sit on the footstool.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for golden palaces and thrones,”
sobbed Proserpina. “Oh, my mother, my mother!
Carry me back to my mother!”</p>

<p>But King Pluto, as he called himself, only
shouted to his steeds to go faster.</p>

<p>“Pray do not be foolish, Proserpina,” said he,
in rather a sullen tone. “I offer you my palace
and my crown, and all the riches that are under
the earth, and you treat me as if I were doing
you an injury. The one thing which my palace
needs is a merry little maid, to run upstairs and
down, and cheer up the rooms with her smile.
And this is what you must do for King Pluto.”</p>

<p>“Never!” answered Proserpina, looking as miserable
as she could. “I shall never smile again till
you set me down at my mother’s door.”</p>

<p>But she might just as well have talked to the
wind that whistled past them; for Pluto urged on
his horses, and went faster than ever. Proserpina
continued to cry out, and screamed so long and
so loudly that her poor little voice was almost
screamed away; and when it was nothing but a
whisper, she happened to cast her eyes over a great,
broad field of waving grain—and whom do you
think she saw? Who, but Mother Ceres, making
the corn grow, and too busy to notice the golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
chariot as it went rattling along. The child mustered
all her strength, and gave one more scream,
but was out of sight before Ceres had time to turn
her head.</p>

<p>King Pluto had taken a road which now began
to grow excessively gloomy. It was bordered on
each side with rocks and precipices, between which
the rumbling of the chariot-wheels was reverberated
with a noise like rolling thunder. The trees and
bushes that grew in the crevices of the rocks had
very dismal foliage; and by and by, although it
was hardly noon, the air became obscured with a
gray twilight. The black horses had rushed along
so swiftly, that they were already beyond the
limits of the sunshine. But the duskier it grew, the
more did Pluto’s visage assume an air of satisfaction.
After all, he was not an ill-looking person,
especially when he left off twisting his features
into a smile that did not belong to them. Proserpina
peeped at his face through the gathering dusk,
and hoped that he might not be so very wicked as
she at first thought him.</p>

<p>“Ah, this twilight is truly refreshing,” said King
Pluto, “after being so tormented with that ugly
and impertinent glare of the sun. How much
more agreeable is lamplight or torchlight, more
particularly when reflected from diamonds! It
will be a magnificent sight when we get to my
palace.”</p>

<p>“Is it much farther?” asked Proserpina. “And
will you carry me back when I have seen it?”</p>

<p>“We will talk of that by and by,” answered
Pluto. “We are just entering my dominions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Do you see that tall gateway before us? When
we pass those gates, we are at home. And there
lies my faithful mastiff at the threshold. Cerberus!
Cerberus! Come hither, my good dog!”</p>

<p>So saying, Pluto pulled at the reins, and stopped
the chariot right between the tall, massive pillars
of the gateway. The mastiff of which he had
spoken got up from the threshold, and stood on his
hinder legs, so as to put his forepaws on the
chariot-wheel. But, my stars, what a strange dog
it was! Why, he was a big, rough, ugly-looking
monster, with three separate heads, and each of
them fiercer than the two others; but, fierce as
they were, King Pluto patted them all. He
seemed as fond of his three-headed dog as if it had
been a sweet little spaniel, with silken ears and
curly hair. Cerberus, on the other hand, was evidently
rejoiced to see his master, and expressed
his attachment, as other dogs do, by wagging his
tail at a great rate. Proserpina’s eyes being
drawn to it by its brisk motion, she saw that this
tail was neither more nor less than a live dragon,
with fiery eyes, and fangs that had a very poisonous
aspect. And while the three-headed Cerberus
was fawning so lovingly on King Pluto, there was
the dragon tail wagging against its will, and looking
as cross and ill-natured as you can imagine, on
its own separate account.</p>

<p>“Will the dog bite me?” asked Proserpina,
shrinking closer to Pluto. “What an ugly creature
he is!”</p>

<p>“Oh, never fear,” answered her companion.
“He never harms people, unless they try to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
my dominions without being sent for, or to get
away when I wish to keep them here. Down,
Cerberus! Now, my pretty Proserpina, we will
drive on.”</p>

<p>On went the chariot, and King Pluto seemed
greatly pleased to find himself once more in his
own kingdom. He drew Proserpina’s attention to
the rich veins of gold that were to be seen among
the rocks, and pointed to several places where one
stroke of a pick-axe would loosen a bushel of diamonds.
All along the road, indeed, there were
sparkling gems, which would have been of inestimable
value above ground, but which were here
reckoned of the meaner sort, and hardly worth a
beggar’s stooping for.</p>

<p>Not far from the gateway, they came to a
bridge, which seemed to be built of iron. Pluto
stopped the chariot, and bade Proserpina look at
the stream which was gliding so lazily beneath it.
Never in her life had she beheld so torpid, so black,
so muddy-looking a stream: its waters reflected no
images of anything that was on the banks, and it
moved as sluggishly as if it had quite forgotten
which way it ought to flow, and had rather stagnate
than flow either one way or the other.</p>

<p>“This is the river Lethe,” observed King Pluto.
“Is it not a very pleasant stream?”</p>

<p>“I think it a very dismal one,” said Proserpina.</p>

<p>“It suits my taste, however,” answered Pluto,
who was apt to be sullen when anybody disagreed
with him. “At all events, its water has one very
excellent quality; for a single draught of it makes
people forget every care and sorrow that has hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
tormented them. Only sip a little of it, my
dear Proserpina, and you will instantly cease to
grieve for your mother, and will have nothing in
your memory that can prevent your being perfectly
happy in my palace. I will send for some,
in a golden goblet, the moment we arrive.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no!” cried Proserpina, weeping
afresh. “I had a thousand times rather be miserable
with remembering my mother, than be happy
in forgetting her. That dear, dear mother! I never,
never will forget her.”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” said King Pluto. “You do not
know what fine times we will have in my palace.
Here we are just at the portal. These pillars are
solid gold, I assure you.”</p>

<p>He alighted from the chariot, and taking Proserpina
in his arms, carried her up a lofty flight
of steps into the great hall of the palace. It was
splendidly illuminated by means of large precious
stones, of various hues, which seemed to burn like
so many lamps, and glowed with a hundredfold
radiance all through the vast apartment. And
yet there was a kind of gloom in the midst of this
enchanted light; nor was there a single object in
the hall that was really agreeable to behold, except
the little Proserpina herself, a lovely child, with
one earthly flower which she had not let fall from
her hand. It is my opinion that even King Pluto
had never been happy in his palace, and that this
was the true reason why he had stolen away Proserpina,
in order that he might have something
to love, instead of cheating his heart any longer
with this tiresome magnificence. And, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
pretended to dislike the sunshine of the upper
world, yet the effect of the child’s presence, bedimmed
as she was by her tears, was as if a faint
and watery sunbeam had somehow or other found
its way into the enchanted hall.</p>

<p>Pluto now summoned his domestics, and bade
them lose no time in preparing a most sumptuous
banquet, and above all things, not to fail of setting
a golden beaker of the water of Lethe by Proserpina’s
plate.</p>

<p>“I will neither drink that nor anything else,”
said Proserpina. “Nor will I taste a morsel of food,
even if you keep me forever in your palace.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry for that,” replied King Pluto,
patting her cheek; for he really wished to be kind,
if he had only known how. “You are a spoiled
child, I perceive, my little Proserpina; but when
you see the nice things which my cook will make
for you, your appetite will quickly come again.”</p>

<p>Then, sending for the head cook, he gave strict
orders that all sorts of delicacies, such as young
people are usually fond of, should be set before
Proserpina. He had a secret motive in this; for,
you are to understand, it is a fixed law, that, when
persons are carried off to the land of magic, if they
once taste any food there, they can never get back
to their friends. Now, if King Pluto had been
cunning enough to offer Proserpina some fruit, or
bread and milk (which was the simple fare to which
the child had always been accustomed), it is very
probable that she would soon have been tempted
to eat it. But he left the matter entirely to his
cook, who, like all other cooks, considered nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fit to eat unless it were rich pastry, or highly
seasoned meat, or spiced sweet cakes—things which
Proserpina’s mother had never given her, and the
smell of which quite took away her appetite, instead
of sharpening it.</p>

<p>But my story must now clamber out of King
Pluto’s dominions, and see what Mother Ceres
has been about, since she was bereft of her daughter.
We had a glimpse of her, as you remember,
half hidden among the waving grain, while the
four black steeds were swiftly whirling along the
chariot in which her beloved Proserpina was so unwillingly
borne away. You recollect, too, the loud
scream which Proserpina gave, just when the
chariot was out of sight.</p>

<p>Of all the child’s outcries, this last shriek was the
only one that reached the ears of Mother Ceres.
She had mistaken the rumbling of the chariot-wheels
for a peal of thunder, and imagined that
a shower was coming up, and that it would assist
her in making the corn grow. But, at the sound
of Proserpina’s shriek, she started, and looked
about in every direction, not knowing whence it
came, but feeling almost certain that it was her
daughter’s voice. It seemed so unaccountable,
however, that the girl should have strayed over
so many lands and seas (which she herself could
not have traversed without the aid of her winged
dragons), that the good Ceres tried to believe that
it must be the child of some other parent, and
not her own darling Proserpina, who had uttered
this lamentable cry. Nevertheless, it troubled her
with a vast many tender fears, such as are ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to bestir themselves in every mother’s heart,
when she finds it necessary to go away from her
dear children without leaving them under the
care of some maiden aunt, or other such faithful
guardian.</p>

<p>So she quickly left the field in which she had
been so busy; and, as her work was not half done,
the grain looked, next day, as if it needed both
sun and rain, and as if it were blighted in the ear,
and had something the matter with its roots.</p>

<p>The pair of dragons must have had very nimble
wings; for, in less than an hour, Mother Ceres had
alighted at the door of her home, and found it
empty. Knowing, however, that the child was
fond of sporting on the seashore, she hastened
thither as fast as she could, and there beheld the
wet faces of the poor sea-nymphs peeping over a
wave. All this while, the good creatures had
been waiting on the bank of sponge, and, once
every half-minute or so, had popped up their four
heads above water, to see if their playmate were
yet coming back. When they saw Mother Ceres,
they sat down on the crest of the surf wave, and
let it toss them ashore at her feet.</p>

<p>“Where is Proserpina?” cried Ceres. “Where
is my child? Tell me, you naughty sea-nymphs,
have you enticed her under the sea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, good Mother Ceres,” said the innocent
sea-nymphs, tossing back their green ringlets, and
looking her in the face. “We never should dream
of such a thing. Proserpina has been at play with
us, it is true; but she left us a long while ago,
meaning only to run a little way upon the dry land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and gather some flowers for a wreath. This was
early in the day, and we have seen nothing of her
since.”</p>

<p>Ceres scarcely waited to hear what the nymphs
had to say, before she hurried off to make inquiries
all through the neighborhood. But nobody told
her anything that could enable the poor mother
to guess what had become of Proserpina. A
fisherman, it is true, had noticed her little footprints
in the sand, as he went homeward along
the beach with a basket of fish; a rustic had seen
the child stooping to gather flowers; several
persons had heard either the rattling of chariot-wheels,
or the rumbling of distant thunder; and
one old woman, while plucking vervain and catnip,
had heard a scream, but supposed it to be some
childish nonsense, and therefore did not take the
trouble to look up. The stupid people! It took
them such a tedious while to tell the nothing that
they knew, that it was dark night before Mother
Ceres found out that she must seek her daughter
elsewhere. So she lighted a torch, and set forth,
resolving never to come back until Proserpina was
discovered.</p>

<p>In her haste and trouble of mind, she quite
forgot her car and the winged dragons; or, it
may be, she thought that she could follow up
the search more thoroughly on foot. At all
events, this was the way in which she began her
sorrowful journey, holding her torch before her,
and looking carefully at every object along the
path. And as it happened, she had not gone far
before she found one of the magnificent flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
which grew on the shrub that Proserpina had
pulled up.</p>

<p>“Ha!” thought Mother Ceres, examining it by
torchlight. “Here is mischief in this flower! The
earth did not produce it by any help of mine, nor
of its own accord. It is the work of enchantment,
and is therefore poisonous; and perhaps it has poisoned
my poor child.”</p>

<p>But she put the poisonous flower in her bosom,
not knowing whether she might ever find any other
memorial of Proserpina.</p>

<p>All night long, at the door of every cottage and
farmhouse, Ceres knocked, and called up the
weary laborers to inquire if they had seen her
child; and they stood, gaping and half asleep, at
the threshold, and answered her pityingly, and besought
her to come in and rest. At the portal of
every palace, too, she made so loud a summons
that the menials hurried to throw open the gate,
thinking that it must be some great king or queen,
who would demand a banquet for supper and a
stately chamber to repose in. And when they
saw only a sad and anxious woman, with a torch
in her hand and a wreath of withered poppies
on her head, they spoke rudely, and sometimes
threatened to set the dogs upon her. But nobody
had seen Proserpina, nor could give Mother Ceres
the least hint which way to seek her. Thus
passed the night; and still she continued her
search without sitting down to rest, or stopping
to take food, or even remembering to put out the
torch; although first the rosy dawn, and then the
glad light of the morning sun, made its red flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
look thin and pale. But I wonder what sort of
stuff this torch was made of; for it burned dimly
through the day, and, at night, was as bright as
ever, and never was extinguished by the rain or
wind, in all the weary days and nights while Ceres
was seeking for Proserpina.</p>

<p>It was not merely of human beings that she
asked tidings of her daughter. In the woods
and by the streams, she met creatures of another
nature, who used, in those old times, to haunt the
pleasant and solitary places, and were very
sociable with persons who understood their language
and customs, as Mother Ceres did. Sometimes,
for instance, she tapped with her finger
against the knotted trunk of a majestic oak; and
immediately its rude bark would cleave asunder,
and forth would step a beautiful maiden, who was
the hamadryad of the oak, dwelling inside of it,
and sharing its long life, and rejoicing when its
green leaves sported with the breeze. But not one
of these leafy damsels had seen Proserpina. Then,
going a little farther, Ceres would, perhaps, come
to a fountain, gushing out of a pebbly hollow in
the earth, and would dabble with her hand in the
water. Behold, up through its sandy and pebbly
bed, along with the fountain’s gush, a young
woman with dripping hair would arise, and stand
gazing at Mother Ceres, half out of the water, and
undulating up and down with its ever-restless
motion. But when the mother asked whether her
poor lost child had stopped to drink out of the
fountain, the naiad, with weeping eyes (for these
water-nymphs had tears to spare for everybody’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
grief), would answer, “No!” in a murmuring voice,
which was just like the murmur of the stream.</p>

<p>Often, likewise, she encountered fauns, who
looked like sunburnt country people, except that
they had hairy ears, and little horns upon their
foreheads, and the hinder legs of goats, on which
they gambolled merrily about the woods and
fields. They were a frolicsome kind of creature,
but grew as sad as their cheerful dispositions
would allow when Ceres inquired for her daughter,
and they had no good news to tell. But sometimes
she came suddenly upon a rude gang of
satyrs, who had faces like monkeys and horses’
tails behind them, and who were generally dancing
in a very boisterous manner, with shouts of noisy
laughter. When she stopped to question them,
they would only laugh the louder, and make new
merriment out of the lone woman’s distress.
How unkind of those ugly satyrs. And once,
while crossing a solitary sheep-pasture, she saw a
personage named Pan, seated at the foot of a
tall rock, and making music on a shepherd’s flute.
He, too, had horns, and hairy ears, and goat’s feet;
but, being acquainted with Mother Ceres, he
answered her question as civilly as he knew how,
and invited her to taste some milk and honey out
of a wooden bowl. But neither could Pan tell her
what had become of Proserpina, any better than
the rest of these wild peoples.</p>

<p>And thus Mother Ceres went wandering about
for nine long days and nights, finding no trace of
Proserpina, unless it were now and then a withered
flower; and these she picked up and put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
her bosom, because she fancied that they might
have fallen from her poor child’s hand. All day
she travelled onward through the hot sun; and at
night, again, the flame of the torch would redden
and gleam along the pathway, and she continued
her search by its light, without ever sitting down
to rest.</p>

<p>On the tenth day, she chanced to espy the mouth
of a cavern, within which (though it was bright
noon everywhere else) there would have been only
a dusky twilight; but it so happened that a torch
was burning there. It flickered, and struggled
with the duskiness, but could not half light up the
gloomy cavern with all its melancholy glimmer.
Ceres was resolved to leave no spot without a
search; so she peeped into the entrance of the
cave, and lighted it up a little more, by holding
her own torch before her. In so doing, she caught
a glimpse of what seemed to be a woman, sitting
on the brown leaves of the last autumn, a great
heap of which had been swept into the cave by the
wind. This woman (if woman it were) was by no
means so beautiful as many of her sex; for her
head, they tell me, was shaped very much like a
dog’s, and, by way of ornament, she wore a wreath
of snakes around it.</p>

<p>But Mother Ceres, the moment she saw her,
knew that this was an odd kind of a person, who
put all her enjoyment in being miserable, and
never would have a word to say to other people,
unless they were as melancholy and wretched as
she herself delighted to be.</p>

<p>“I am wretched enough now,” thought poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Ceres, “to talk with this melancholy Hecate, were
she ten times sadder than ever she was yet.”</p>

<p>So she stepped into the cave, and sat down on
the withered leaves by the dog-headed woman’s side.
In all the world, since her daughter’s loss, she had
found no other companion.</p>

<p>“O Hecate,” said she, “if ever you lose a daughter,
you will know what sorrow is. Tell me, for
pity’s sake, have you seen my poor child Proserpina
pass by the mouth of your cavern?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Hecate, in a cracked voice, and
sighing betwixt every word or two—“no, Mother
Ceres, I have seen nothing of your daughter. But
my ears, you must know, are made in such a way
that all cries of distress and affright, all over the
world, are pretty sure to find their way to them;
and nine days ago, as I sat in my cave, making
myself very miserable, I heard the voice of a young
girl, shrieking as if in great distress. Something
terrible has happened to the child, you may rest
assured. As well as I could judge, a dragon, or
some other cruel monster, was carrying her away.”</p>

<p>“You kill me by saying so,” cried Ceres, almost
ready to faint. “Where was the sound, and which
way did it seem to go?”</p>

<p>“It passed very swiftly along,” said Hecate,
“and, at the same time, there was a heavy rumbling
of wheels towards the eastward. I can tell you
nothing more, except that, in my honest opinion,
you will never see your daughter again. The best
advice I can give you is, to take up your abode in
this cavern, where we will be the two most wretched
women in the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not yet, dark Hecate,” replied Ceres. “But do
you first come with your torch, and help me to seek
for my lost child. And when there shall be no more
hope of finding her (if that black day is ordained
to come), then, if you will give me room to fling
myself down, either on these withered leaves or on
the naked rock, I will show you what it is to be miserable.
But, until I know that she has perished
from the face of the earth, I will not allow myself
space even to grieve.”</p>

<p>The dismal Hecate did not much like the idea of
going abroad into the sunny world. But then she
reflected that the sorrow of the disconsolate Ceres
would be like a gloomy twilight round about them
both, let the sun shine ever so brightly, and that
therefore she might enjoy her bad spirits, quite as
well as if she were to stay in the cave. So she
finally consented to go, and they set out together,
both carrying torches, although it was broad daylight
and clear sunshine. The torchlight seemed
to make a gloom; so that the people whom they met
along the road could not very distinctly see their
figures; and, indeed, if they once caught a glimpse
of Hecate, with the wreath of snakes round her
forehead, they generally thought it prudent to run
away, without waiting for a second glance.</p>

<p>As the pair travelled along in this woe-begone
manner, a thought struck Ceres.</p>

<p>“There is one person,” she exclaimed, “who
must have seen my poor child, and can doubtless
tell what has become of her. Why did not I think
of him before? It is Phœbus.”</p>

<p>“What,” said Hecate, “the young man that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
always sits in the sunshine? Oh, pray do not think
of going near him. He is a gay, light, frivolous
young fellow, and will only smile in your face.
And besides, there is such a glare of the sun about
him, that he will quite blind my poor eyes, which I
have almost wept away already.”</p>

<p>“You have promised to be my companion,” answered
Ceres. “Come, let us make haste, or the
sunshine will be gone, and Phœbus along with it.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, they went along in quest of Phœbus,
both of them sighing grievously, and Hecate,
to say the truth, making a great deal worse lamentation
than Ceres; for all the pleasure she had, you
know, lay in being miserable, and therefore she
made the most of it. By and by, after a pretty long
journey, they arrived at the sunniest spot in the
whole world. There they beheld a beautiful young
man, with long, curling ringlets, which seemed to
be made of golden sunbeams; his garments were
like light summer clouds; and the expression of his
face was so exceedingly vivid, that Hecate held her
hands before her eyes, muttering that he ought to
wear a black veil. Phœbus (for this was the very
person whom they were seeking) had a lyre in his
hands, and was making its chords tremble with
sweet music; at the same time singing a most exquisite
song, which he had recently composed. For,
besides a great many other accomplishments,
this young man was renowned for his admirable
poetry.</p>

<p>As Ceres and her dismal companion approached
him, Phœbus smiled on them so cheerfully that
Hecate’s wreath of snakes gave a spiteful hiss, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Hecate heartily wished herself back in her cave.
But as for Ceres, she was too earnest in her grief
either to know or care whether Phœbus smiled or
frowned.</p>

<p>“Phœbus,” exclaimed she, “I am in great trouble,
and have come to you for assistance. Can you tell
me what has become of my dear child Proserpina?”</p>

<p>“Proserpina! Proserpina, did you call her name?”
answered Phœbus, endeavoring to recollect; for
there was such a continual flow of pleasant ideas in
his mind that he was apt to forget what had happened
no longer ago than yesterday. “Ah, yes, I
remember her now. A very lovely child, indeed.
I am happy to tell you, my dear madam, that I did
see the little Proserpina not many days ago. You
may make yourself perfectly easy about her. She
is safe, and in excellent hands.”</p>

<p>“Oh, where is my dear child?” cried Ceres, clasping
her hands and flinging herself at his feet.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Phœbus—and as he spoke, he kept
touching his lyre so as to make a thread of music
run in and out among his words—“as the little
damsel was gathering flowers (and she has really a
very exquisite taste for flowers) she was suddenly
snatched up by King Pluto, and carried off to his
dominions. I have never been in that part of the
universe; but the royal palace, I am told, is built in
a very noble style of architecture, and of the most
splendid and costly materials. Gold, diamonds,
pearls, and all manner of precious stones will be
your daughter’s ordinary playthings. I recommend
to you, my dear lady, to give yourself no uneasiness.
Proserpina’s sense of beauty will be duly gratified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and, even in spite of the lack of sunshine, she will
lead a very enviable life.”</p>

<p>“Hush! Say not such a word!” answered Ceres,
indignantly. “What is there to gratify her heart?
What are all the splendors you speak of, without
affection? I must have her back again. Will you
go with me, Phœbus, to demand my daughter of
this wicked Pluto?”</p>

<p>“Pray excuse me,” replied Phœbus, with an elegant
obeisance. “I certainly wish you success, and
regret that my own affairs are so immediately pressing
that I cannot have the pleasure of attending
you. Besides, I am not upon the best of terms with
King Pluto. To tell you the truth, his three-headed
mastiff would never let me pass the gateway; for I
should be compelled to take a sheaf of sunbeams
along with me, and those, you know, are forbidden
things in Pluto’s kingdom.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Phœbus,” said Ceres, with bitter meaning in
her words, “you have a harp instead of a heart.
Farewell.”</p>

<p>“Will not you stay a moment,” asked Phœbus,
“and hear me turn the pretty and touching story of
Proserpina into extemporary verses?”</p>

<p>But Ceres shook her head, and hastened away,
along with Hecate. Phœbus (who, as I have told
you, was an exquisite poet) forthwith began to
make an ode about the poor mother’s grief; and, if
we were to judge of his sensibility by this beautiful
production, he must have been endowed with a very
tender heart. But when a poet gets into the habit
of using his heart strings to make chords for his
lyre, he may thrum upon them as much as he will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
without any great pain to himself. Accordingly,
though Phœbus sang a very sad song, he was as
merry all the while as were the sunbeams amid
which he dwelt.</p>

<p>Poor Mother Ceres had now found out what had
become of her daughter, but was not a whit happier
than before. Her case, on the contrary, looked more
desperate than ever. As long as Proserpina was
above ground there might have been hopes of
regaining her. But now that the poor child was
shut up within the iron gates of the king of the
mines, at the threshold of which lay the three-headed
Cerberus, there seemed no possibility of her ever
making her escape. The dismal Hecate, who loved
to take the darkest view of things, told Ceres that
she had better come with her to the cavern, and
spend the rest of her life in being miserable. Ceres
answered that Hecate was welcome to go back
thither herself, but that, for her part, she would
wander about the earth in quest of the entrance to
King Pluto’s dominions. And Hecate took her at
her word, and hurried back to her beloved cave,
frightening a great many little children with a
glimpse of her dog’s face, as she went.</p>

<p>Poor Mother Ceres! It is melancholy to think
of her pursuing her toilsome way all alone, and
holding up that never-dying torch, the flame of
which seemed an emblem of the grief and hope
that burned together in her heart. So much did
she suffer, that, though her aspect had been quite
youthful when her troubles began, she grew to look
like an elderly person in a very brief time. She
cared not how she was dressed, nor had she ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
thought of flinging away the wreath of withered
poppies, which she put on the very morning of
Proserpina’s disappearance. She roamed about in
so wild a way, and with her hair so dishevelled, that
people took her for some distracted creature, and
never dreamed that this was Mother Ceres, who had
the oversight of every seed which the husbandman
planted. Nowadays, she gave herself no trouble
about seed-time nor harvest, but left the farmers to
take care of their own affairs, and the crops to fade
or flourish, as the case might be. There was nothing,
now, in which Ceres seemed to feel an interest
unless when she saw children at play, or gathering
flowers along the wayside. Then, indeed, she would
stand and gaze at them with tears in her eyes. The
children, too, appeared to have a sympathy with her
grief, and would cluster themselves in a little group
about her knees, and look up wistfully in her face;
and Ceres, after giving them a kiss all round, would
lead them to their homes, and advise their mothers
never to let them stray out of sight.</p>

<p>“For if they do,” said she, “it may happen to
you, as it has to me, that the iron-hearted King
Pluto will take a liking to your darlings, and snatch
them up in his chariot, and carry them away.”</p>

<p>One day, during her pilgrimage in quest of the
entrance to Pluto’s kingdom, she came to the palace
of King Celeus, who reigned at Eleusis. Ascending
a lofty flight of steps, she entered the portal, and
found the royal household in very great alarm about
the queen’s baby. The infant, it seems, was sickly
(being troubled with its teeth, I suppose), and
would take no food, and was all the time moaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with pain. The queen—her name was Metanira—was
desirous of finding a nurse; and when she beheld
a woman of matronly aspect coming up the
palace steps, she thought, in her own mind, that
here was the very person whom she needed. So
Queen Metanira ran to the door, with the poor wailing
baby in her arms, and besought Ceres to take
charge of it, or, at least, to tell her what would do
it good.</p>

<p>“Will you trust the child entirely to me?” asked
Ceres.</p>

<p>“Yes, and gladly, too,” answered the queen, “if
you will devote all your time to him. For I can see
that you have been a mother.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Ceres. “I once had a child
of my own. Well; I will be the nurse of this poor,
sickly boy. But beware, I warn you, that you do
not interfere with any kind of treatment which I
may judge proper for him. If you do so, the poor
infant must suffer for his mother’s folly.”</p>

<p>Then she kissed the child, and it seemed to do
him good; for he smiled and nestled closely into her
bosom.</p>

<p>So Mother Ceres set her torch in a corner (where
it kept burning all the while), and took up her
abode in the palace of King Celeus, as nurse to the
little Prince Demophoön. She treated him as if he
were her own child, and allowed neither the king
nor the queen to say whether he should be bathed in
warm or cold water, or what he should eat, or how
often he should take the air, or when he should be
put to bed. You would hardly believe me, if I were
to tell how quickly the baby prince got rid of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
ailments, and grew fat, and rosy, and strong, and
how he had two rows of ivory teeth in less time
than any other little fellow, before or since. Instead
of the palest, and wretchedest, and puniest imp in
the world (as his own mother confessed him to be
when Ceres first took him in charge), he was now a
strapping baby, crowing, laughing, kicking up his
heels, and rolling from one end of the room to the
other. All the good women of the neighborhood
crowded to the palace, and held up their hands, in
unutterable amazement, at the beauty and wholesomeness
of this darling little prince. Their wonder
was the greater, because he was never seen to taste
any food; not even so much as a cup of milk.</p>

<p>“Pray, nurse,” the queen kept saying, “how is it
that you make the child thrive so?”</p>

<p>“I was a mother once,” Ceres always replied;
“and having nursed my own child, I know what
other children need.”</p>

<p>But Queen Metanira, as was very natural, had a
great curiosity to know precisely what the nurse did
to her child. One night, therefore, she hid herself
in the chamber where Ceres and the little prince
were accustomed to sleep. There was a fire in the
chimney, and it had now crumbled into great
coals and embers, which lay glowing on the hearth,
with a blaze flickering up now and then, and flinging
a warm and ruddy light upon the walls. Ceres sat
before the hearth with the child in her lap, and the
firelight making her shadow dance upon the ceiling
overhead. She undressed the little prince, and
bathed him all over with some fragrant liquid out
of a vase. The next thing she did was to rake back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the red embers, and make a hollow place among
them, just where the backlog had been. At last,
while the baby was crowing, and clapping its fat
little hands, and laughing in the nurse’s face (just
as you may have seen your little brother or sister do
before going into its warm bath), Ceres suddenly
laid him, all naked as he was, in the hollow among
the red-hot embers. She then raked the ashes over
him, and turned quietly away.</p>

<p>You may imagine, if you can, how Queen
Metanira shrieked, thinking nothing less than that
her dear child would be burned to a cinder. She
burst forth from her hiding-place, and running to
the hearth, raked open the fire, and snatched up
poor little Prince Demophoön out of his bed of live
coals, one of which he was gripping in each of his
fists. He immediately set up a grievous cry, as
babies are apt to do when rudely startled out of a
sound sleep. To the queen’s astonishment and joy,
she could perceive no token of the child’s being
injured by the hot fire in which he had lain. She
now turned to Mother Ceres, and asked her to
explain the mystery.</p>

<p>“Foolish woman,” answered Ceres, “did you not
promise to intrust this poor infant entirely to me?
You little know the mischief you have done him.
Had you left him to my care, he would have grown
up like a child of celestial birth, endowed with
superhuman strength and intelligence, and would
have lived forever. Do you imagine that earthly
children are to become immortal without being tempered
to it in the fiercest heat of the fire? But you
have ruined your own son. For though he will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a strong man and a hero in his day, yet, on account
of your folly, he will grow old, and finally die, like
the sons of other women. The weak tenderness of
his mother has cost the poor boy an immortality.
Farewell.”</p>

<p>Saying these words, she kissed the little prince,
Demophoön, and sighed to think what he had lost,
and took her departure without heeding Queen
Metanira, who entreated her to remain, and cover
up the child among the hot embers as often as she
pleased. Poor baby! He never slept so warmly
again.</p>

<p>While she dwelt in the king’s palace, Mother
Ceres had been so continually occupied with taking
care of the young prince, that her heart was a little
lightened of its grief for Proserpina. But now,
having nothing else to busy herself about, she
became just as wretched as before. At length, in
her despair, she came to the dreadful resolution that
not a stalk of grain, nor a blade of grass, not a
potato, nor a turnip, nor any other vegetable that
was good for man or beast to eat, should be suffered
to grow until her daughter were restored. She even
forbade the flowers to bloom, lest somebody’s heart
should be cheered by their beauty.</p>

<p>Now, as not so much as a head of asparagus ever
presumed to poke itself out of the ground, without
the especial permission of Ceres, you may conceive
what a terrible calamity had here fallen upon the
earth. The husbandmen ploughed and planted as
usual; but there lay the rich black furrows, all as
barren as a desert of sand. The pastures looked as
brown in the sweet month of June as ever they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in chill November. The rich man’s broad acres and
the cottager’s small garden-patch were equally
blighted. Every little girl’s flower-bed showed
nothing but dry stalks. The old people shook their
white heads, and said that the earth had grown aged
like themselves, and was no longer capable of wearing
the warm smile of summer on its face. It was
really piteous to see the poor, starving cattle and
sheep, how they followed behind Ceres, lowing and
bleating, as if their instinct taught them to expect
help from her; and everybody that was acquainted
with her power besought her to have mercy on the
human race, and, at all events, to let the grass
grow. But Mother Ceres, though naturally of an
affectionate disposition, was now inexorable.</p>

<p>“Never,” said she. “If the earth is ever again
to see any verdure, it must first grow along the
path which my daughter will tread in coming back
to me.”</p>

<p>Finally, as there seemed to be no other remedy,
our old friend Quicksilver was sent post haste to
King Pluto, in hopes that he might be persuaded to
undo the mischief he had done, and to set everything
right again, by giving up Proserpina. Quicksilver
accordingly made the best of his way to the great
gate, took a flying leap right over the three-headed
mastiff, and stood at the door of the palace in an
inconceivably short time. The servants knew him
both by his face and garb; for his short cloak, and
his winged cap and shoes, and his snaky staff had
often been seen thereabouts in times gone by. He
requested to be shown immediately into the king’s
presence; and Pluto, who heard his voice from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
top of the stairs, and who loved to recreate himself
with Quicksilver’s merry talk, called out to him to
come up. And while they settle their business together,
we must inquire what Proserpina has been
doing ever since we saw her last.</p>

<p>The child had declared, as you may remember,
that she would not taste a mouthful of food as long
as she should be compelled to remain in King
Pluto’s palace. How she contrived to maintain her
resolution, and at the same time to keep herself
tolerably plump and rosy, is more than I can explain;
but some young ladies, I am given to understand,
possess the faculty of living on air, and
Proserpina seems to have possessed it, too. At any
rate, it was now six months since she left the outside
of the earth; and not a morsel, so far as the attendants
were able to testify, had yet passed between
her teeth. This was the more creditable to Proserpina,
inasmuch as King Pluto had caused her to be
tempted, day after day, with all manner of sweetmeats,
and richly preserved fruits, and delicacies of
every sort, such as young people are generally most
fond of. But her good mother had often told her
of the hurtfulness of these things; and for that reason
alone, if there had been no other, she would have
resolutely refused to taste them.</p>

<p>All this time, being of a cheerful and active
disposition, the little damsel was not quite so unhappy
as you may have supposed. The immense
palace had a thousand rooms, and was full of beautiful
and wonderful objects. There was a never-ceasing
gloom, it is true, which half hid itself among
the innumerable pillars, gliding before the child as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
she wandered among them, and treading stealthily
behind her in the echo of her footsteps. Neither
was all the dazzle of the precious stones, which
flamed with their own light, worth one gleam of
natural sunshine; nor could the most brilliant of the
many-colored gems, which Proserpina had for playthings,
vie with the simple beauty of the flowers she
used to gather. But, still wherever the girl went,
among those gilded halls and chambers, it seemed
as if she carried nature and sunshine along with
her, and as if she scattered dewy blossoms on her
right hand and on her left. After Proserpina came,
the palace was no longer the same abode of stately
artifice and dismal magnificence that it had before
been. The inhabitants all felt this, and King Pluto
more than any of them.</p>

<p>“My own little Proserpina,” he used to say, “I
wish you could like me a little better. We gloomy
and cloudy-natured persons have often as warm
hearts at bottom, as those of a more cheerful character.
If you would only stay with me of your
own accord, it would make me happier than the
possession of a hundred such palaces as this.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Proserpina, “you should have tried to
make me like you before carrying me off. And the
best thing you can do now is, to let me go again.
Then I might remember you sometimes, and think
that you were as kind as you knew how to be. Perhaps,
too, one day or other, I might come back, and
pay you a visit.”</p>

</div>

<p>“No, no,” answered Pluto, with his gloomy smile,
“I will not trust you for that. You are too fond
of living in the broad daylight, and gathering flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
What an idle and childish taste that is! Are
not these gems, which I have ordered to be dug for
you, and which are richer than any in my crown—are
they not prettier than a violet?”</p>

<p>“Not half so pretty,” said Proserpina, snatching
the gems from Pluto’s hand, and flinging them to
the other end of the hall. “Oh my sweet violets,
shall I never see you again?”</p>

<p>And then she burst into tears. But young people’s
tears have very little saltness or acidity in
them, and do not inflame the eyes so much as those
of grown persons; so that it is not to be wondered
at if, a few moments afterwards, Proserpina was
sporting through the hall almost as merrily as she
and the four sea-nymphs had sported along the edge
of the surf wave. King Pluto gazed after her, and
wished that he, too, was a child. And little Proserpina,
when she turned about, and beheld this great
king standing in his splendid hall, and looking so
grand, and so melancholy, and so lonesome, was
smitten with a kind of pity. She ran back to him,
and, for the first time in all her life, put her small
soft hand in his.</p>

<p>“I love you a little,” whispered she, looking up
in his face.</p>

<p>“Do you, indeed, my dear child!” cried Pluto,
bending his dark face down to kiss her; but Proserpina
shrank away from the kiss, for though his
features were noble, they were very dusky and grim.
“Well, I have not deserved it of you, after keeping
you a prisoner for so many months, and starving
you besides. Are you not terribly hungry? Is
there nothing which I can get you to eat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>In asking this question, the king of the mines had
a very cunning purpose; for, you will recollect, if
Proserpina tasted a morsel of food in his dominions,
she would never afterwards be at liberty to quit
them.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Proserpina. “Your head cook
is always baking, and stewing, and roasting, and
rolling out paste, and contriving one dish or another,
which he imagines may be to my liking. But
he might just as well save himself the trouble, poor,
fat little man that he is. I have no appetite for
anything in the world, unless it were a slice of bread
of my mother’s own baking, or a little fruit out of
her garden.”</p>

<p>When Pluto heard this, he began to see that he
had mistaken the best method of tempting Proserpina
to eat. The cook’s made dishes and artificial
dainties were not half so delicious, in the good child’s
opinion, as the simple fare to which Mother Ceres
had accustomed her. Wondering that he had never
thought of it before, the king now sent one of his
trusty attendants, with a large basket, to get some
of the finest and juiciest pears, peaches, and plums
which could anywhere be found in the upper world.
Unfortunately, however, this was during the time
when Ceres had forbidden any fruits or vegetables
to grow; and, after seeking all over the earth, King
Pluto’s servant found only a single pomegranate,
and that so dried up as to be not worth eating.
Nevertheless, since there was no better to be had, he
brought this dry, old withered pomegranate home
to the palace, put it on a magnificent golden salver,
and carried it up to Proserpina. Now it happened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
curiously enough, that, just as the servant was
bringing the pomegranate into the back door of the
palace, our friend Quicksilver had gone up the front
steps, on his errand to get Proserpina away from
King Pluto.</p>

<p>As soon as Proserpina saw the pomegranate on
the golden salver, she told the servant he had better
take it away again.</p>

<p>“I shall not touch it, I assure you,” said she. “If
I were ever so hungry, I should never think of eating
such a miserable, dry pomegranate as that.”</p>

<p>“It is the only one in the world,” said the servant.</p>

<p>He set down the golden salver, with the wizened
pomegranate upon it, and left the room. When he
was gone, Proserpina could not help coming close
to the table, and looking at this poor specimen of
dried fruit with a great deal of eagerness; for, to
say the truth, on seeing something that suited her
taste, she felt all the six months’ appetite taking
possession of her at once. To be sure, it was a very
wretched-looking pomegranate, and seemed to have
no more juice in it than an oyster-shell. But there
was no choice of such things in King Pluto’s palace.
This was the first fruit she had seen there, and the
last she was ever likely to see; and unless she ate
it up immediately, it would grow drier than it
already was, and be wholly unfit to eat.</p>

<p>“At least, I may smell it,” thought Proserpina.
So she took up the pomegranate, and applied it to
her nose; and, somehow or other, being in such close
neighborhood to her mouth, the fruit found its way
into that little red cave. Dear me! what an everlasting
pity! Before Proserpina knew what she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
about, her teeth had actually bitten it, of their own
accord. Just as this fatal deed was done, the door
of the apartment opened, and in came King Pluto,
followed by Quicksilver, who had been urging him
to let his little prisoner go. At the first noise of
their entrance, Proserpina withdrew the pomegranate
from her mouth. But Quicksilver (whose
eyes were very keen, and his wits the sharpest that
ever anybody had) perceived that the child was a
little confused; and seeing the empty salver, he
suspected that she had been taking a sly nibble of
something or other. As for honest Pluto, he never
guessed at the secret.</p>

<p>“My little Proserpina,” said the king, sitting
down, and affectionately drawing her between his
knees, “here is Quicksilver, who tells me that a
great many misfortunes have befallen innocent people
on account of my detaining you in my dominions.
To confess the truth, I myself had already
reflected that it was an unjustifiable act to take you
away from your good mother. But, then, you must
consider, my dear child, that this vast palace is apt
to be gloomy (although the precious stones certainly
shine very bright), and that I am not of the most
cheerful disposition, and that therefore it was a
natural thing enough to seek for the society of some
merrier creature than myself. I hoped you would
take my crown for a plaything, and me—ah, you
laugh, naughty Proserpina—me, grim as I am, for
a playmate. It was a silly expectation.”</p>

<p>“Not so extremely silly,” whispered Proserpina.
“You have really amused me very much,
sometimes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” said King Pluto, rather dryly.
“But I can see, plainly enough, that you think my
palace a dusky prison, and me the iron-hearted
keeper of it. And an iron heart I should surely
have, if I could detain you here any longer, my
poor child, when it is now six months since you
tasted food. I give you your liberty. Go with
Quicksilver. Hasten home to your dear mother.”</p>

<p>Now, although you may not have supposed it,
Proserpina found it impossible to take leave of
poor King Pluto without some regrets, and a good
ideal of compunction for not telling him about the
pomegranate. She even shed a tear or two, thinking
how lonely and cheerless the great palace would
seem to him, with all its ugly glare of artificial
light, after she herself—his one little ray of natural
sunshine, whom he had stolen, to be sure, but only
because he valued her so much—after she should
have departed. I know not how many kind things
she might have said to the disconsolate king of
the mines, had not Quicksilver hurried her away.</p>

<p>“Come along quickly,” whispered he in her
ear, “or his Majesty may change his royal mind.
And take care, above all things, that you say
nothing of what was brought you on the golden
salver.”</p>

<p>In a very short time, they had passed the great
gateway (leaving the three-headed Cerberus barking,
and yelping, and growling, with threefold
din, behind them), and emerged upon the surface
of the earth. It was delightful to behold, as
Proserpina hastened along, how the path grew
verdant behind and on either side of her. Wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
she set her blessed foot, there was at once a dewy
flower. The violets gushed up along the wayside.
The grass and the grain began to sprout with tenfold
vigor and luxuriance, to make up for the
dreary months that had been wasted in barrenness.
The starved cattle immediately set to work grazing,
after their long fast, and ate enormously all
day, and got up at midnight to eat more. But I
can assure you it was a busy time of year with the
farmers, when they found the summer coming upon
them with such a rush. Nor must I forget to say
that all the birds in the whole world hopped about
upon the newly blossoming trees, and sang together
in a prodigious ecstasy of joy.</p>

<p>Mother Ceres had returned to her deserted
home, and was sitting disconsolately on the doorstep,
with her torch burning in her hand. She
had been idly watching the flame for some moments
past, when, all at once, it flickered and went
out.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” thought she. “It was
an enchanted torch, and should have kept burning
till my child came back.”</p>

<p>Lifting her eyes, she was surprised to see a sudden
verdure flashing over the brown and barren
fields, exactly as you may have observed a golden
hue gleaming far and wide across the landscape,
from the just risen sun.</p>

<p>“Does the earth disobey me?” exclaimed Mother
Ceres, indignantly. “Does it presume to be green,
when I have bidden it be barren, until my daughter
shall be restored to my arms?”</p>

<p>“Then open your arms, dear mother,” cried a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
well-known voice, “and take your little daughter
into them.”</p>

<p>And Proserpina came running, and flung herself
upon her mother’s bosom. Their mutual transport
is not to be described. The grief of their separation
had caused both of them to shed a great
many tears; and now they shed a great many more,
because their joy could not so well express itself
in any other way.</p>

<p>When their hearts had grown a little more quiet,
Mother Ceres looked anxiously at Proserpina.</p>

<p>“My child,” said she, “did you taste any food
while you were in King Pluto’s palace?”</p>

<p>“Dearest mother,” answered Proserpina, “I will
tell you the whole truth. Until this very morning,
not a morsel of food had passed my lips. But to-day,
they brought me a pomegranate (a very dry
one it was, and all shrivelled up, till there was little
left of it but seeds and skin), and having seen no
fruit for so long a time, and being faint with hunger,
I was tempted just to bite it. The instant I
tasted it, King Pluto and Quicksilver came into
the room. I had not swallowed a morsel; but—dear
mother, I hope it was no harm—but six of
the pomegranate seeds, I am afraid, remained in
my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Ah, unfortunate child, and miserable me!” exclaimed
Ceres. “For each of those six pomegranate
seeds you must spend one month of every year
in King Pluto’s palace. You are but half restored
to your mother. Only six months with me, and
six with that good-for-nothing King of Darkness!”</p>

<p>“Do not speak so harshly of poor King Pluto,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
said Proserpina, kissing her mother. “He has some
very good qualities; and I really think I can bear
to spend six months in his palace, if he will only
let me spend the other six with you. He certainly
did very wrong to carry me off; but then, as he
says, it was but a dismal sort of life for him, to live
in that great gloomy place, all alone; and it has
made a wonderful change in his spirits to have a
little girl to run up stairs and down. There is some
comfort in making him so happy; and so, upon
the whole, dearest mother, let us be thankful that
he is not to keep me the whole year round.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Minerva was the goddess of Wisdom, but
on one occasion she did a very foolish thing;
she entered into competition with Juno and Venus
for the prize of beauty.</p>

<p>At the marriage of Peleus and Thetis all the gods
and goddesses were invited with the exception of
Eris, or Discord. Enraged at her exclusion, the
goddess threw a golden apple among the guests,
with the inscription, “For the fairest,” Thereupon
Juno, Venus, and Minerva each claimed the apple.</p>

<p>Jupiter, not willing to decide in so delicate a
matter, sent the goddesses to Mount Ida, where
the beautiful shepherd Paris was tending his flocks,
and to him was committed the decision. The goddesses
accordingly appeared before him. Juno
promised him power and riches, Minerva glory and
renown in war, and Venus the fairest of women for
his wife, each attempting to bias his decision in her
own favor.</p>

<p>Paris decided in favor of Venus and gave her the
golden apple, thus making the two other goddesses
his enemies. Under the protection of Venus, Paris
sailed to Greece, and was hospitably received by
Menelaus, King of Sparta.</p>

<p>Now Helen, the wife of Menelaus, was the very
woman whom Venus had destined for Paris, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
most beautiful woman in the world. She had been
sought as a bride by numerous suitors, and before
her decision was made known, they all, at the suggestion
of Ulysses, one of their number, took an
oath that they would defend her from all injury
and avenge her cause if necessary. She chose
Menelaus, and was living with him happily when
Paris became their guest. Paris, aided by Venus,
persuaded her to elope with him, and carried her
to Troy, whence arose the famous Trojan war, the
subject of the greatest poems of antiquity, those
of Homer and Virgil.</p>

<p>Menelaus called upon his brother chieftains of
Greece to fulfil their pledge, and join him in his
efforts to recover his wife. Most of them came
forward, but Ulysses, who had married Penelope,
and was very happy with his wife and child, had no
wish to embark in such a troublesome affair. He
therefore hung back and Palamedes was sent to
urge him. When Palamedes arrived at Ithaca
Ulysses pretended to be mad. He yoked an ass
and an ox together to the plough and began to
sow salt. Palamedes, to try him, placed the infant
Telemachus before the plough, whereupon the
father turned the plough aside, showing plainly
that he was no madman, and after that could no
longer refuse to fulfil his promise.</p>

<p>Being now gained for the undertaking, he lent
his aid to bring in other chiefs, especially Achilles.
This hero was the son of that Thetis at whose marriage
the apple of Discord had been thrown among
the goddesses. Thetis was herself one of the Immortals,
a sea-nymph, and knowing that her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
was fated to perish before Troy if he went on the
expedition, she endeavored to prevent his going.
She sent him away to the court of King Lycomedes,
and induced him to conceal himself in the disguise
of a maiden among the daughters of the king.
Ulysses, hearing he was there, went disguised as a
merchant to the palace and offered for sale female
ornaments, among which he had placed some arms.
While the king’s daughters were engrossed with
the other contents of the merchant’s pack, Achilles
handled the weapons and thereby betrayed himself
to the keen eye of Ulysses, who found no great difficulty
in persuading him to disregard his mother’s
prudent counsels and join his countrymen in the
war.</p>

<p>Priam was King of Troy, and Paris, the shepherd,
was his son. Paris had been brought up in
obscurity, because there were certain ominous forebodings
connected with him from his infancy that
he would be the ruin of the state. These forebodings
seemed at length likely to be realized, for the
Grecian armament now in preparation was the
greatest that had ever been fitted out.</p>

<p>Agamemnon, King of Mycenæ, and brother of
the injured Menelaus, was chosen commander-in-chief.
Achilles was their most illustrious warrior.
After him ranked Ajax, gigantic in size and of
great courage, but dull of intellect; Diomede, second
only to Achilles in all the qualities of a hero;
Ulysses, famous for his sagacity; and Nestor, the
oldest of the Grecian chiefs, and one to whom they
all looked up for counsel.</p>

<p>But Troy was no feeble enemy. Priam, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
king, was now old, but he had been a wise prince
and had strengthened his state by good government
at home and numerous alliances with his
neighbors. But the principal stay and support of
his throne was his son Hector, one of the noblest
characters painted by heathen antiquity. He felt,
from the first, presentiment of the fall of his country,
but still persevered in his heroic resistance, yet
by no means justified the wrong which brought
this danger upon her. He was united in marriage
with Andromaché, and as a husband and father
his character was not less admirable than as a
warrior. The principal leaders on the side of the
Trojans, besides Hector, were Æneas and Deïphobus,
Glaucus, and Sarpedon.</p>

<h3 id="THE_QUARREL_OF_THE_CHIEFS">THE QUARREL OF THE CHIEFS</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">For nine years and more the Greeks besieged
the city of Troy. Being many in number,
and having strong and valiant chiefs, they pressed
the men of the city very hard, so that these durst
not go outside the walls. They might have taken
it without further loss but that there arose a
deadly strife between two of the chiefs, Agamemnon,
King of Mycenæ, who was sovereign lord of
all the host; and Achilles, who was the bravest and
most valiant man therein.</p>

<p>The Greeks, having been away from home many
years, were in great want of many things, so it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
was their custom to leave a part of the army to
watch the city, and to send a part to plunder such
towns in the country round about as they knew to
be friendly to the men of Troy, or as they thought
to contain good store of provision or treasure.
“Are not all these,” they were wont to say, “towns
of the barbarians, and therefore lawful prey to
men that are Greeks?” Now among the towns
with which they dealt in this fashion was Chrysa,
which was sacred to Apollo, who had a great temple
therein and a priest. Fearing the anger of the
gods, the Greeks had not harmed the temple or
the priest; but they had carried off with other
prisoners the priest’s daughter, Chryseïs by name.
These and the rest of the spoil they divided among
the kings, of whom there were many in the army,
each ruling his own people. Now King Agamemnon,
as being sovereign lord, went not with the
army at such times, but stayed behind, having
charge of the siege that it should not be neglected.
Yet he always received, as was fitting, a share of
the spoil. This time the Greeks gave him, with
other things, the maiden Chryseïs. Next day there
came to the camp the priest Chryses, wishing to
ransom his daughter. Much gold he brought, and
he had on his head the priest’s crown, that men
might reverence him the more. He went to all the
chiefs, making his prayer that they would take
the gold and give him back his daughter. They all
spake him fair, and would have done what he
wished, except Agamemnon.</p>

<p>“Get thee out, greybeard!” he cried in great
wrath. “Let me not find thee lingering now by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the ships, neither coming hither again, or it shall
be the worse for thee, for all thy priesthood. And
as for thy daughter, I shall carry her away to
Argos, when I shall have taken this city of Troy.”</p>

<p>Then the old man went out hastily in great fear
and trouble, and he walked in his sorrow by the
shore of the sounding sea, and prayed to his god
Apollo. “Hear me, god of the silver bow. If I
have built thee a temple, and offered thee the fat
of many bullocks and rams, hear me, and avenge
me on these Greeks!”</p>

<p>And Apollo heard him. He was angry that
men had so dishonored his priest, and came down
from the top of Olympus, where he dwelt. Dreadful
was the rattle of his arrows as he advanced,
and his presence was as the night coming over
the sky.</p>

<p>He shot the arrows of death, first at the dogs
and the mules, and then at the men; and soon all
along the shore rolled the black smoke from the
piles of wood on which they burnt the bodies of the
dead.</p>

<p>On the tenth day Achilles, who was the bravest
and strongest of all the Greeks, called the people
to an assembly. When they were gathered together
he stood up among them and spake to
Agamemnon. “Surely it were better to return
home than that we should all perish here by the
plague. Come, let us ask some prophet, or priest,
or dreamer of dreams, why it is that Apollo is so
wroth with us.”</p>

<p>Then stood up Calchas, best of seers, who knew
what had been, and what was, and what was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
come, and spake. “Achilles, thou biddest me tell
the people why Apollo is wroth with them. Lo! I
tell thee, but thou must first swear to stand by me,
for I know that what I shall say will anger King
Agamemnon, and it goes ill with common men
when kings are angry.”</p>

<p>“Speak out, thou wise man!” cried Achilles;
“for I swear by Apollo that while I live no one
shall lay hands on thee, no, not Agamemnon,
though he be sovereign lord of the Greeks.”</p>

<p>Then the prophet took heart and spake. “It is
on behalf of his priest that Apollo is wroth, for he
came to ransom his daughter, but Agamemnon
would not let the maiden go. Now, then, ye must
send her back to Chrysa without ransom, and with
her a hundred beasts for sacrifice, so that the plague
may be stayed.”</p>

<p>Then Agamemnon stood up in a fury, his eyes
blazing like fire. “Never,” he cried, “hast thou
spoken good concerning me, ill prophet that thou
art, and now thou tellest me to give up this maiden!
I will do it, for I would not that the people should
perish. Only take care, ye Greeks, that there be
a share of the spoil for me, for it would ill beseem
the lord of all the host that he alone should be
without his share.”</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord Agamemnon,” cried Achilles,
“thou art too eager for gain. We have no treasures
out of which we may make up thy loss, for
what we got out of the towns we have either sold
or divided; nor would it be fitting that the people
should give back what has been given to them.
Give up the maiden, then, without conditions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
when we shall have taken this city of Troy, we
will repay thee three and four fold.”</p>

<p>“Nay, great Achilles,” said Agamemnon, “thou
shalt not cheat me thus. If the Greeks will give
me such a share as I should have, well and good.
But if not, I will take one for myself, whether it
be from thee, or from Ajax, or from Ulysses; for
my share I will have. But of this hereafter. Now
let us see that this maiden be sent back. Let them
get ready a ship, and put her therein, and with
her a hundred victims, and let some chief go
with the ship, and see that all things be rightly
done.”</p>

<p>Then cried Achilles, and his face was black as a
thunder-storm, “Surely thou art altogether shameless
and greedy, and, in truth, an ill ruler of men.
No quarrel have I with the Trojans. They never
harried oxen or sheep of mine. But I have been
fighting in thy cause, and that of thy brother Menelaus.
Naught carest thou for that. Thou leavest
me to fight, and sittest in thy tent at ease. But
when the spoil is divided, thine is always the lion’s
share. Small indeed is my part—‘a little thing,
but dear.’ And this, forsooth, thou wilt take away!
Now am I resolved to go home. Small booty wilt
thou get then, methinks!”</p>

<p>And King Agamemnon answered, “Go and thy
Myrmidons with thee! I have other chieftains as
good as thou art, and ready, as thou art not, to
pay me due respect. I hate thee, with thy savage,
bloodthirsty ways. And as for the matter of the
spoil, know that I will take thy share, the girl
Briseïs, and fetch her myself, if need be, that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
may know that I am sovereign lord here in the
hosts of the Greeks.”</p>

<p>Then Achilles was mad with anger, and he
thought in his heart, “Shall I arise and slay this
caitiff, or shall I keep down the wrath in my
breast?” And as he thought he laid his hand on
his sword-hilt, and had half drawn his sword from
the scabbard, when lo! the goddess Minerva stood
behind him (for Juno who loved both this chieftain
and that, had sent her), and caught him by the
long locks of his yellow hair. But Achilles marvelled
much to feel the mighty grasp, and turned,
and looked, and knew the goddess, but no one else
in the assembly might see her. Then his eyes
flashed with fire, and he cried, “Art thou come,
child of Jupiter, to see the insolence of Agamemnon?
Of a truth, I think that he will perish for
his folly.”</p>

<p>But Minerva said, “Nay, but I am come to stay
thy wrath. Use bitter words, if thou wilt, but put
up thy sword in its sheath, and strike him not. Of
a truth, I tell thee that for this insolence of to-day
he will bring thee hereafter splendid gifts, threefold
and fourfold for all that he may take away.”</p>

<p>Then Achilles answered, “I shall abide by thy
command, for it is ever better for a man to obey
the immortal gods.” And as he spake he laid his
heavy hand upon the hilt, and thrust back the
sword into the scabbard, and Minerva went her
way to Olympus.</p>

<p>Then he turned him to King Agamemnon, and
spake again. “Drunkard, with the eyes of a dog
and the heart of a deer! never fighting in the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of the battle, nor daring to lie in the ambush! ’Tis
a puny race thou rulest, or this had been thy last
wrong. And as for me, here is this scepter: once
it was the branch of a tree, but a cunning craftsman
bound it with bronze to be the sign of the lordship
which Jupiter gives to kings; as surely as it
shall never again have bark or leaves or shoot, so
surely shall the Greeks one day miss Achilles, when
they fall in heaps before the dreadful Hector, and
thou shalt eat thy heart to think that thou hast
wronged the bravest of thy host.”</p>

<p>And as he spake he dashed his scepter on the
ground and sat down. And on the other side
Agamemnon sat in furious anger. Then Nestor
rose, an old man of a hundred years and more, and
counselled peace. Let them listen, he said, to his
counsel. Great chiefs in the old days, with whom
no man now alive would dare to fight, had listened.
Let not Agamemnon take away from the bravest
of the Greeks the prize of war; let not Achilles,
though he was mightier in battle than all other
men, contend with Agamemnon, who was sovereign
lord of all the hosts of Greece. But he spake
in vain. For Agamemnon answered—“Nestor,
thou speakest well, and peace is good. But this
fellow would lord it over all, and he must be taught
that there is one here, at least, who is better
than he.”</p>

<p>And Achilles said, “I were a slave and a coward
if I owned thee as my lord. Not so: play the
master over others, but think not to master me.
As for the prize which the Greeks gave me, let
them do as they will. They gave it; let them take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
it away. But if thou darest to touch aught that is
mine own, that hour thy life-blood shall redden on
my spear.”</p>

<p>Then the assembly was dismissed. Chryseïs
was sent to her home with due offerings to the
god, the wise Ulysses going with her. And all the
people purified themselves, and the plague was
stayed.</p>

<p>But King Agamemnon would not go back from
his purpose. So he called to him the heralds, Talthybius
and Eurybates, and said, “Heralds, go to
the tents of Achilles and fetch the maiden Briseïs.
But if he will not let her go, say that I will come
myself with many others to fetch her; so will it be
the worse for him.”</p>

<p>Sorely against their will the heralds went.
Along the seashore they walked, till they came
to the tents of Achilles. There they found him
sitting, but stood silent in awe and fear.</p>

<p>Achilles spied them, and cried aloud, “Come
near, ye heralds, messengers of gods and men. ’Tis
no fault of yours that ye are come on such an
errand.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to Patroclus, his dearest friend,
and said, “Bring the maiden from her tent, and let
the heralds lead her away. But let them be witnesses,
before gods and men, and before this evil-minded
king, against the day when he shall have
sore need of me to save his host from destruction.
Fool that he is, who thinks not of the past nor of
the future, that his people may be safe!”</p>

<p>Then Patroclus brought forth the maiden from
her tent and gave her to the heralds. And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
led her away, but it was sorely against her will that
she went. Achilles went apart from his comrades
and sat upon the seashore, falling into a great
passion of tears, and stretching out his hands with
loud prayer to his mother, who indeed was a goddess
of the sea, Thetis by name. She heard him
where she sat in the depths by her father, the old
god of the sea, and rose—you would have thought
it a mist rising—from the waves, and came to where
he sat weeping, and stroked him with her hand, and
called him by his name.</p>

<p>“What ails thee, my son?” she said.</p>

<p>Then he told her the story of his wrong, and
when he had ended he said—</p>

<p>“Go, I pray thee, to the top of Olympus, to
the palace of Jupiter. Often have I heard thee
boast how, long ago, thou didst help him when
the other gods would have bound him, fetching
Briareus of the hundred hands, who sat by him,
so that the gods feared to touch him. Go now and
call these things to his mind, and pray him that he
help the sons of Troy and give them victory in the
battle, so that the Greeks, as they flee before them,
may have joy of this king of theirs, who has done
such wrong to the bravest of his host.”</p>

<p>And his mother answered him, “Surely thine is
an evil lot, my son! Thy life is short, and it should
of right be without tears and full of joy; but now
it seems to me to be both short and sad. I will go
as thou sayest to Olympus, to the palace of Jupiter,
but not now, for he has gone, and the other gods
with him, to a twelve days’ feast with the pious
Ethiopians. But when he comes back I will entreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and persuade him. And do thou sit still, nor
go forth to battle.”</p>

<p>When the twelve days were past, Thetis went
to the top of Olympus, to the palace of Jupiter
and made her prayer to him. He was loath to
grant it, for he knew that it would anger his wife,
Juno, who loved the Greeks and hated the sons
of Troy. Yet he could not refuse her, and promised
that it should be as she wished. And to make
his word the surer, he nodded his awful head, and
with the nod all Olympus was shaken.</p>

<p>That night Jupiter took counsel with himself
how he might best work his will. He called to
him a dream, and said, “Dream, go to the tent of
Agamemnon, and tell him to set his army in array
against Troy, for the gods are now of one mind,
and the day of doom is come for the city; so he
shall take it, and gain eternal glory for himself.”</p>

<p>So the dream went to the tent of Agamemnon,
and it took the shape of Nestor, the old chief whom
the king honored more than all beside.</p>

<p>Then the false Nestor spake: “Sleepest thou,
Agamemnon? It is not for kings to sleep all
through the night, for they must take thought for
many, and have many cares. Listen now to the
words of Jupiter: ‘Set the battle in array against
Troy, for the gods are now of one mind, and the
day of doom is come for the city, and thou shalt
take it, and gain eternal glory for thyself.”</p>

<p>And Agamemnon believed the dream, and knew
not the purpose of Jupiter in bidding him go forth
to battle. So he rose from his bed and donned his
tunic, and over it a great cloak, fastened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sandals on his feet, hung from his shoulders his
mighty silver-studded sword, and took in his right
hand the great scepter of his house, which was the
token of his sovereignty over all the Greeks. Then
he went forth, and first took counsel with the
chiefs, and afterwards called the people to the assembly.
After the assembly the shrill-voiced heralds
called the host to the battle. As is the flare of
a great fire when a wood is burning on a hill-top,
so was the flash of their arms and their armor as
they thronged to the field. And as the countless
flocks of wild geese or cranes or swans now wheel
and now settle in the great Asian marsh by the
stream of Cayster, or as the bees swarm in the
spring, when the milk-pails are full, so thick the
Greeks thronged to the battle in the great plain by
the banks of the Scamander. Many nations were
there, and many chiefs, and the bravest and strongest
of all was Ajax, son of Telamon, and the best
horses were the horses of Eumelus; but there was
none that could compare with Achilles and the
horses of Achilles, bravest man and swiftest steeds.
Only Achilles sat apart, and would not go to the
battle.</p>

<p>And on the other side the sons of Troy and their
allies came forth from the gates of the city with
the most famous of their chiefs.</p>

<p>So the battle was set in array, and the two hosts
stood over against each other.</p>

<h3 id="THE_FIGHT_BETWEEN_PARIS_AND">THE FIGHT BETWEEN PARIS AND
MENELAUS</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">They were now about to fight, when from the
ranks of the Trojans Paris rushed forth. He
had a panther’s skin over his shoulders, and a bow
and a sword, and in either hand a spear, and he
called aloud to the Greeks that they should send
forth their bravest to fight with them.</p>

<p>When Menelaus saw him he was glad, for he said
that now he should avenge himself on the man who
had done him such wrong. So a lion is glad when,
being sorely hungered, he finds a stag or a wild
goat; he devours it, and will not be driven from it
by dogs or hunters.</p>

<p>He leapt from his chariot and rushed to meet his
enemy; but Paris, having done evil, and being therefore
a coward in his heart, was afraid when he saw
Menelaus, and fled back into the ranks of his comrades,
just as a man steps back in haste when,
unawares, he comes upon a snake. Hector saw him
and rebuked him. “Fair art thou to look upon,
Paris, but nothing worth. Surely the Greeks will
scorn us if they think that thou art our bravest
warrior, because thou art of stately presence. Thou
art a coward; and yet thou daredst to go across the
sea and carry off the fair Helen. Why dost thou
not stand and abide the onset of her husband, and
see what manner of man he is? Little would thy
harp and thy long locks and thy fair face avail
when thou wert lying in the dust! A craven race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
are the sons of Troy, or they would have stoned thee
ere this.”</p>

<p>Then Paris answered, “Thou speakest well,
Hector, and thy rebuke is just. As for thee, thy
heart is like iron, ever set on battle; yet are beauty
and love also the gifts of the gods, and not to be
despised. But now set Menelaus and me in the
midst, and let us fight, man to man, for the fair
Helen and for all her possessions. And if he prevail
over me, let him take her and them and depart, and
the Greeks with him, but ye shall dwell in peace;
but if I prevail they shall depart without her.”</p>

<p>Then Hector was glad, and going before the
Trojan ranks, holding his spear by the middle, he
kept them back. The Greeks would have thrown
spears and stones at him, only Agamemnon cried
aloud and said, “Hold: Hector has somewhat to
say to us.”</p>

<p>Then Hector said, “Hear, Trojans and Greeks,
what Paris saith: Let all besides lay their arms
upon the ground, and let Menelaus and me fight
for the fair Helen and all her wealth. And let him
that is the better keep her and them, but the rest
shall dwell in peace.”</p>

<p>Then Menelaus said, “The word pleaseth me
well; let us fight together, and let us make agreement
with oath and sacrifice. And because the
sons of Priam are men of fraud and violence, let
Priam himself come.”</p>

<p>So they sent a herald to King Priam, but he
sat on the wall with the old men. And as they
talked the fair Helen came near, and they said,
“What wonder that men should suffer much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
such a woman, for indeed she is divinely fair. Yet
let her depart in the ships, nor bring a curse on us
and our children.”</p>

<p>But Priam called to her, “Come near, my daughter;
tell me about these old friends of thine. For
’tis not thou, ’tis the gods who have brought about
all this trouble. But tell me, who is this warrior
that I see, so fair and strong? There are others
even a head taller than he, but none of such
majesty.”</p>

<p>And Helen answered, “Ah, my father! would
that I had died before I left husband and child
to follow thy son. But as for this warrior, he is
Agamemnon, a good king and brave soldier and
my brother-in-law in the old days.”</p>

<p>“Happy Agamemnon,” said Priam, “to rule over
so many! Never saw I such an army gathered
together, not even when I went to help the Phrygians
when they were assembled on the banks of
the Sangarus against the Amazons. But who is this
that I see, not so tall as Agamemnon, but of broader
shoulders? His arms lie upon the ground, and he
is walking through the ranks of his men just as
some great ram walks through a flock of sheep.”</p>

<p>“This,” said Helen, “is Ulysses of Ithaca, who
is better in craft and counsel than all other men.”</p>

<p>“’Tis well spoken, lady,” said Antenor. “Well
I remember Ulysses when he came hither on an
embassy about thee with the brave Menelaus. My
guests they were, and I knew them well. And I
remember how, in the assembly of the Trojans,
when both were standing, Menelaus was the taller,
but when they sat, Ulysses was the more majestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to behold. And when they rose to speak, Menelaus
said few words, but said them wisely and well; and
Ulysses—you had thought him a fool, so stiffly he
held his scepter and so downcast were his eyes; but
as soon as he began, oh! the mighty voice, and the
words thick as the falling snow!”</p>

<p>Then Priam said, “Who is that stalwart hero,
so tall and strong, overtopping all by head and
shoulders?”</p>

<p>“That,” said Helen, “is mighty Ajax, the
bulwark of the Greeks. And next to him is Idomeneus.
Often has Menelaus had him as his guest
in the old days, when he came from Crete. As for
the other chiefs, I see and could name them all.
But I miss my own dear brothers, Castor, tamer of
horses, and Pollux, the mighty boxer. Either they
came not from Sparta, or having come, shun the
meeting of men for shame of me” (she knew not
that they were sleeping their last sleep far away
in their dear fatherland).</p>

<p>And when they had ended talking, the heralds
came and told King Priam that the armies called
for him. So he went, and Antenor with him. And
he on the one side, for the Trojans, and King
Agamemnon for the Greeks, made a covenant with
sacrifice that Paris and Menelaus should fight
together, and that the fair Helen, with all her
treasures, should go with him who should win.
Hector and Ulysses marked out a space for the
fight, and Hector shook two pebbles in a helmet,
looking away as he shook them, that he whose pebble
leapt forth the first should be the first to throw his
spear. And it so befell that the lot of Paris leapt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
forth first. The two warriors armed themselves
and came forth into the space, and stood over
against each other, brandishing their spears, with
hate in their eyes. Then Paris threw his spear. It
struck the shield of Menelaus, but pierced it not,
for the spear point was bent back. Then Menelaus
prayed to Jupiter, “Grant, Father Jupiter, that I
may avenge myself on Paris, who has done me this
wrong; so shall men in after time fear to do wrong
to their host.” So speaking, he cast his long-shafted
spear. It struck the shield of Paris and pierced
it through, and passed through the corslet, and
through the tunic close to the loin; but Paris
shrank aside and the spear wounded him not. Then
Menelaus drew his silver-studded sword and struck
a mighty blow on the top of the helmet of Paris,
but the sword broke in four pieces in his hand.
Then he cried in his wrath, “O Jupiter, most
mischief-loving of the gods, my spear I cast in vain,
and now my sword is broken.” Then he rushed
forward and seized Paris by the helmet, and
dragged him towards the host of the Greeks. And
truly he had taken him, but Venus loosed the strap
that was beneath his chin, and the helmet came off
in his hand. And Menelaus whirled it among the
Greeks and charged with another spear in his hand.
But Venus snatched Paris away, covering him
with a mist, and put him down in his chamber in
Troy. Then Menelaus looked for him everywhere,
but no one could tell him where he might be. No
son of Troy would have hidden him out of kindness,
for all hated him as death.</p>

<p>Then King Agamemnon said, “Now, ye sons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Troy, it is for you to give back the fair Helen and
her wealth, and to pay me besides so much as may
be fitting for all my cost and trouble.”</p>

<p>But it was not the will of the gods that the
sons of Troy should do this thing. So Minerva
took upon herself the shape of Laodocus, son of
Antenor, and went to Pandarus, son of Lycaon,
where he stood among his men. Then the false
Laodocus said, “Pandarus, darest thou aim an
arrow at Menelaus? Truly the Trojans would
love thee well, and Paris best of all, if they could
see Menelaus slain by an arrow from thy bow.
Aim then, but first pray to Apollo, and vow that
thou wilt offer a hundred beasts when thou returnest
to thy city, Zeleia.” Now Pandarus had a bow
made of the horns of a wild goat which he had
slain; sixteen palms long they were, and a cunning
workman had made them smooth, and put a tip of
gold whereon to fasten the bow-string. And Pandarus
strung his bow, his comrades hiding him with
their shields. Then he took an arrow from his
quiver, and laid it on the bow-string, and drew
the string to his breast, till the arrow-head touched
the bow, and let fly. Right well aimed was the
dart, but it was not the will of heaven that it should
slay Menelaus. It struck him, indeed, and passed
through the belt and through the corslet and
through the girdle, and pierced the skin.</p>

<p>Sore dismayed was King Agamemnon to see the
blood; sore dismayed also was the brave Menelaus,
till he spied the barb of the arrow, and knew that
the wound was not deep. But Agamemnon cried—</p>

<p>“It was in an evil hour for thee, my brother, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
I made a covenant with these false sons of Troy.
Right well, indeed, I know that oath and sacrifice
are not in vain, but will have vengeance at the last.
Troy shall fall; but woe is me if thou shouldst die,
Menelaus. For the Greeks will straight go back
to their fatherland, and the fair Helen will be left
a boast to the sons of Troy, and I shall have great
shame when one of them shall say, as he leaps on
the tomb of the brave Menelaus, ‘Surely the great
Agamemnon has avenged himself well; for he
brought an army hither, but now is gone back to
his home, but left Menelaus here.’ May the earth
swallow me up before that day!”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Menelaus, “fear not, for the arrow
has but grazed the skin.”</p>

<p>Then King Agamemnon bade fetch the physician.
So the herald fetched Machaon, the
physician. And Machaon came, and drew forth
the arrow, and when he had wiped away the blood
he put healing drugs upon the wound, which Chiron,
the wise healer, had given to his father.</p>

<h3 id="THE_DUEL_BETWEEN_HECTOR_AND">THE DUEL BETWEEN HECTOR AND
AJAX</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">The Greeks went forward to the battle, as the
waves that curl themselves and then dash
upon the shore, throwing high the foam. In order
they went after their chiefs; you had thought them
dumb, so silent were they. But the Trojans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
like a flock of ewes which wait to be milked, and
bleat hearing the voice of their lambs, so confused
a cry went out from their army, for there were men
of many tongues gathered together. And on either
side the gods urged them on, but chiefly Minerva
the Greeks and Mars the sons of Troy. Then, as
two streams in flood meet in some chasm, so the
armies dashed together, shield on shield and spear
on spear.</p>

<p>Now when Minerva saw that the Greeks were
perishing by the hand of Hector and his companions,
it grieved her sore. So she came down
from the heights of Olympus, if happily she might
help them. And Apollo met her and said, “Art
thou come, Minerva, to help the Greeks whom thou
lovest? Well, let us stay the battle for this day;
hereafter they shall fight till the doom of Troy be
accomplished.”</p>

<p>But Minerva answered, “How shall we stay it?”</p>

<p>And Apollo said, “We will set on Hector to
challenge the bravest of the Greeks to fight with
him, man to man.”</p>

<p>So they two put the matter into the mind of
Helenus the seer. Then Helenus went near to
Hector, “Listen to me, for I am thy brother. Cause
the rest of the sons of Troy and of the Greeks to sit
down, and do thou challenge the bravest of the
Greeks to fight with thee, man to man. And be
sure thou shalt not fall in the battle, for the will
of the immortal gods is so.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then Hector greatly rejoiced, and passed to
the front of the army, holding his spear by the
middle, and kept back the sons of Troy; and King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Agamemnon did likewise with his own people.
Then Hector spake—</p>

<p>“Hear me, sons of Troy, and ye men of Greece.
The covenant that we made one with another hath
been broken, for Jupiter would have it so, purposing
evil to both, till either you shall take our
high-walled city or we shall conquer you by your
ships. But let one of you who call yourselves
champions of the Greeks come forth and fight with
me, man to man. And let it be so that if he
vanquish me he shall spoil me of my arms but give
my body to my people, that they may burn it with
fire; and if I vanquish him, I will spoil him of his
arms but give his body to the Greeks, that they
may bury him and raise a great mound above him
by the broad salt river of Hellespont. And so men
of after days shall see it, sailing by, and say, ‘This
is the tomb of the bravest of the Greeks, whom
Hector slew.’ So shall my name live forever.”</p>

<p>But all the Greeks kept silence, fearing to meet
him in battle, but shamed to hold back. Then at
last Menelaus leapt forward and spake, “Surely
now ye are women and not men. Foul shame it
were should there be no man to stand up against
this Hector. Lo! I will fight with him my own
self, for the issues of battle are with the immortal
gods.”</p>

<p>So he spake in his rage rashly, courting death,
for Hector was much stronger than he. Then King
Agamemnon answered, “Nay, but this is folly, my
brother. Seek not in thy anger to fight with one
that is stronger than thou; for as for this Hector,
even Achilles was loth to meet him. Sit thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
down among thy comrades, and the Greeks will
find some champion who shall fight with him.”</p>

<p>And Menelaus hearkened to his brother’s words,
and sat down. Then Nestor rose in the midst and
spake—</p>

<p>“Woe is me to-day for Greece! How would the
old Peleus grieve to hear such a tale! Well I
remember how he rejoiced when I told him of the
house and lineage of all chieftains of the Greeks,
and now he would hear that they cower before
Hector, and are sore afraid when he calls them to
the battle. Surely he would pray this day that he
might die! O that I were such as I was in the old
days, when the men of Pylos fought with the
Arcadians! I, who was the youngest of all, stood
forth, and Minerva gave me glory that day, for
I slew their leader, though he was the strongest
and tallest among the sons of men. Would that
I were such to-day! Right soon would I meet this
mighty Hector.”</p>

<p>Then rose up nine chiefs of fame. First of all,
King Agamemnon, lord of many nations, and next
to him Diomed, and Ajax the Greater and Ajax
the Less, and then Idomeneus and Meriones, and
Eurypylus, and Thoas, son of Andræmon, and the
wise Ulysses.</p>

<p>Then Nestor said, “Let us cast lots who shall
do battle with the mighty Hector.”</p>

<p>So they threw the lots into the helmet of King
Agamemnon, a lot for each. And the people
prayed, “Grant, ye gods, that the lot of Ajax the
Greater may leap forth, or the lot of Diomed, or
the lot of King Agamemnon.” Then Nestor shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the lots in the helmet, and the one which they most
wished leapt forth. For the herald took it through
the ranks and showed it to the chiefs, but none
knew it for his own till he came to where Ajax the
Greater stood among his comrades. But Ajax had
marked it with his mark, and put forth his hand
for it, and claimed it, right glad at heart. On the
ground by his feet he threw it, and said—</p>

<p>“Mine is the lot, my friends, and right glad I am,
for I think that I shall prevail over the mighty
Hector, but come, let me don my arms; and pray
ye to Jupiter, but silently, lest the Trojans hear,
or aloud, if ye will, for no fear have we. Not by
force or craft shall any one vanquish me, for not
such are the men whom Salamis breeds.”</p>

<p>So he armed himself and moved forwards,
smiling with grim face. With mighty strides he
came, brandishing his long-shafted spear. The
Greeks were glad to behold him, but the knees of
the Trojans were loosened with fear and great
Hector’s heart beat fast; but he trembled not, nor
gave place, seeing that he had himself called him
to battle. So Ajax came near, holding before the
great shield, like a wall, which Tychius, best of
craftsmen, had made for him. Seven folds of bull’s
hide it had, and an eighth of bronze. Threateningly
he spake—</p>

<p>“Now shalt thou know, Hector, what manner
of men there are yet among our chiefs, though
Achilles the lion-hearted is far away, sitting idly in
his tent, in great wrath with King Agamemnon.
Do thou, then, begin the battle.”</p>

<p>“Speak not to me, Jupiter-descended Ajax,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
said Hector, “as though I were a woman or a
child knowing nothing of war. Well I know all the
arts of battle, to ply my shield this way and that,
to guide my car through the tumult of steeds, and
to stand fighting hand to hand. But I would not
smite so stout a foe by stealth, but openly.”</p>

<p>As he spake he hurled his long-shafted spear,
and smote the great shield on the rim of the eighth
fold, that was of bronze. Through six folds it
passed, but in the seventh it was stayed. Then
Ajax hurled his spear, striking Hector’s shield.
Through shield it passed and corslet, and cut the
tunic close against the loin; but Hector shrank
away and escaped the doom of death. Then, each
with a fresh spear, they rushed together like lions
or wild boars of the wood. First Hector smote
the middle of the shield of Ajax, but pierced it not,
for the spear-point was bent back; then Ajax, with
a great bound, drove his spear at Hector’s shield
and pierced it, forcing him back, and grazing his
neck so that the blood welled out. Yet did not
Hector cease from the combat. He caught up a
great stone from the ground, and hurled it at the
boss of the sevenfold shield. Loud rang the
bronze, but the shield broke not. Then Ajax took
a stone heavier by far, and threw it with all his
might. It broke the shield of Hector, and bore
him backwards, so that he fell at length with his
shield above him. But Apollo raised him up.
Then did both draw their swords; but ere they
could join in close battle the heralds came and held
their scepters between them, and Idæus, the herald
of Troy, spake—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fight no more, my sons; Jupiter loves you
both; and ye are both mighty warriors. That we
all know right well. But now the night bids you
cease, and it is well to heed its bidding.”</p>

<p>Then said Ajax, “Nay, Idæus, but it is for
Hector to speak, for he called the bravest of the
Greeks to battle. And as he wills it, so will I.”</p>

<p>And Hector said, “O Ajax, the gods have given
thee stature and strength and skill, nor is there
any better warrior among the Greeks. Let us
cease then from the battle; we may yet meet again,
till the gods give the victory to me or thee. And
now let us give gifts the one to the other, so that
Trojans and Greeks may say—Hector and Ajax
met in fierce fight and parted in friendship.”</p>

<p>So Hector gave to Ajax a silver-studded sword
with the scabbard and the sword-belt, and Ajax
gave to Hector a buckler splendid with purple.
So they parted. Right glad were the sons of Troy
when they saw Hector returning safe. Glad also
were the Greeks, as they led Ajax rejoicing in his
victory to King Agamemnon. Whereupon the
king called the chiefs to banquet together, and bade
slay an ox of five years old, and Ajax he honored
most of all. When the feast was ended Nestor
said—</p>

<p>“It were well that we should cease awhile from
war and burn the dead, for many, in truth, are
fallen. And we will build a great wall and dig
a trench about it, and we will make wide gates that
a chariot may pass through, so that our ships may
be safe, if the sons of Troy should press us hard.”</p>

<p>But the next morning came a herald from Troy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to the chiefs as they sat in council by the ship of
King Agamemnon, and said—</p>

<p>“This is the word of Priam and the men of
Troy; Paris will give back all the treasures of the
fair Helen, and many more besides; but the fair
Helen herself he will not give. But if this please
you not, grant us a truce, that we may bury our
dead.”</p>

<p>Then Diomed spake, “Nay, we will not take the
fair Helen’s self, for a man may know even
though he be a fool, that the doom of Troy is
come.”</p>

<p>And King Agamemnon said, “Herald, thou hast
heard the word of the Greeks, but as for the truce,
be it as you will.”</p>

<p>So the next day they burnt their dead, and the
Greeks made a wall with gates and dug a trench
about it. And when it was finished, even at sunset,
they made ready a meal, and lo! there came
ships from Lemnos bringing wine, and Greeks
bought thereof, some with bronze, and some with
iron, and some with shields of ox hide. All night
they feasted right joyously. The sons of Troy also
feasted in their city. But the dreadful thunder
rolled through the night, for Jupiter was counselling
evil against them.</p>

<h3 id="THE_DEEDS_AND_DEATH_OF">THE DEEDS AND DEATH OF
PATROCLUS</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Patroclus stood by Achilles, weeping
bitterly. Then said Achilles, “What ails thee,
Patroclus, that thou weepest like a girl-child that
runs along by her mother’s side and would be taken
up, holding her gown, and looking at her with
tearful eyes till she lift her in her arms? Hast thou
heard evil news from Phthia? Menœtius yet lives,
they say, and Peleus. Or art thou weeping for the
Greeks, because they perish for their folly?”</p>

<p>Then said Patroclus, “Be not wroth with me,
great Achilles, for indeed the Greeks are in
grievous straits, and all their bravest are wounded,
and still thou cherishest thy wrath. If thou goest
not to the battle, fearing some warning from the
gods, let me go, and thy Myrmidons with me. And
let me put thy armor on me; so shall the Greeks
have breathing space from the war.”</p>

<p>So he spake, entreating, nor knew that for his
own doom he entreated. And Achilles made
reply—</p>

<p>“It is no warning that I heed, that I keep back
from the war. But these men took from me my
prize, which I won with my own hands. But let
the past be past. I said that I would not rise up till
the battle should come nigh to my own ships. But
thou mayest put my armor upon thee, and lead
my Myrmidons to the fight. For in truth the men
of Troy are gathered as a dark cloud about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
ships, and the Greeks have scarce standing-ground
between them and the sea. For they see not the
gleam of my helmet. And Diomed is not there
with his spear; nor do I hear the voice of Agamemnon,
but only the voice of Hector, as he calls
the men of Troy to the battle. Go, therefore,
Patroclus, and drive the fire from the ships. And
then come thou back, nor fight any more with the
Trojans, lest thou take my glory from me. And
go not near, in the delight of battle, to the walls
of Troy, lest one of the gods meet thee to thy hurt;
and, of a truth, the keen archer Apollo loves them
well.”</p>

<p>But as they talked the one to the other, Ajax
could hold out no longer. For swords and javelins
came thick upon him, and clattered on his helmet,
and his shoulder was weary with the great shield
which he held; and he breathed heavily and hard,
and the great drops of sweat fell upon the ground.
Then at the last Hector came near and smote his
spear with a great sword, so that the head fell off.
Then was Ajax sore afraid, and gave way, and the
men of Troy set torches to the ship’s stem, and a
great flame shot up to the sky. And Achilles saw
it, and smote his thigh and spake—</p>

<p>“Haste thee, Patroclus, for I see the fire rising
up from the ships. Put thou on the armor, and
I will call my people to the war.”</p>

<p>So Patroclus put on the armor—corslet and
shield and helmet—and bound upon his shoulder
the silver-studded sword, and took a mighty spear
in his hand. But the great Pelian spear he took
not, for that no man but Achilles might wield.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Then Automedon yoked the horses to the chariot,
Bayard and Piebald, and with them in the side
harness, Pedasus; and they two were deathless
steeds, but he was mortal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Achilles had called the Myrmidons
to battle. Fifty ships had he brought to Troy, and
in each there were fifty men.</p>

<p>Five leaders they had, and the bravest of the five
was Pisander.</p>

<p>Then Achilles said, “Forget not, ye Myrmidons,
the bold words that ye spake against the men of
Troy during the days of my wrath, making complaint
that I kept you from the battle against
your will. Now, therefore, ye have that which you
desired.”</p>

<p>So the Myrmidons went to the battle in close
array, helmet to helmet and shield to shield, close
as the stones with which a builder builds a wall.
And in front went Patroclus, and Automedon in
the chariot beside him. Then Achilles went to his
tent and took a great cup from the chest which
Thetis his mother had given him. Now no man
drank of that cup but he only, nor did he pour out
of it libations to any of the gods but only to
Jupiter. This first he cleansed with sulphur, and
then with water from the spring. And after this
he washed his hands, and stood in the midst of the
space before his tent, and poured out of it to
Jupiter, saying—</p>

<p>“O Jupiter, I send my comrade to this battle;
make him strong and bold, and give him glory, and
bring him home safe to the ships and my people
with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>So he prayed, and Father Jupiter heard him,
and part he granted and part denied.</p>

<p>But now Patroclus with the Myrmidons had
come to where the battle was raging about the ship
of Protesilaus, and when the men of Troy beheld
him, they thought that Achilles had forgotten his
wrath, and was come forth to the war. And first
Patroclus slew Pyræchmes, who was the chief of
the Pæonians who live on the banks of the broad
Axius. Then the men of Troy turned to flee, and
many chiefs of fame fell by the spears of the
Greeks. So the battle rolled back to the trench,
and in the trench many chariots of the Trojans
were broken, but the horses of Achilles went across
it at a stride, so nimble were they and strong. And
the heart of Patroclus was set to slay Hector; but
he could not overtake him, so swift were his horses.
Then did Patroclus turn his chariot and keep back
those that fled, that they should not go to the city,
and rushed hither and thither, still slaying as he
went.</p>

<p>Then did Patroclus forget the word which
Achilles had spoken to him, that he should not go
near to Troy, for he pursued the men of the city
even to the wall. Thrice he mounted on the angle
of the wall, and thrice Apollo himself drove him
back, pushing his shining shield. But the fourth
time the god said, “Go thou back, Patroclus. It
is not for thee to take the city of Troy; no, nor for
Achilles, who is far better than thou art.”</p>

<p>So Patroclus went back, fearing the wrath of
the archer-god. Then Apollo stirred up the spirit
of Hector, that he should go against Patroclus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Therefore he went, with his brother Cebriones for
driver of his chariot. But when they came near,
Patroclus cast a great stone which he had in his
hand, and smote Cebriones on the forehead, crushing
it in, so that he fell headlong from the chariot.
And Patroclus mocked him, saying—</p>

<p>“How nimble is this man! how lightly he dives!
What spoil he would take of oysters, diving from
a ship, even in a stormy sea! Who would have
thought that there were such skilful divers in
Troy!”</p>

<p>Then again the battle waxed hot about the body
of Cebriones, and this too, at the last, the Greeks
drew unto themselves, and spoiled it of the arms.
And this being accomplished, Patroclus rushed
against the men of Troy. Thrice he rushed, and
each time he slew nine chiefs of fame. But the
fourth time Apollo stood behind him and struck
him on the head and shoulders, so that his eyes
were darkened. And the helmet fell from off his
head, so that the horsehair plumes were soiled with
dust. Never before had it touched the ground, for
it was the helmet of Achilles. And also the god
brake the spear in his hand, and struck the shield
from his arms, and loosed his corslet. All amazed
he stood, and then Euphorbus, son of Panthoüs,
smote him on the back with his spear, but slew him
not. Then Patroclus sought to flee to the ranks
of his comrades. But Hector saw him, and thrust
at him with his spear, smiting him in the groin,
so that he fell. And when the Greeks saw him fall,
they sent up a terrible cry. Then Hector stood
over him and cried—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didst thou think to spoil our city, Patroclus,
and to carry away our wives and daughters in the
ships? But lo! I have slain thee, and the fowls of
the air shall eat thy flesh; nor shall the great
Achilles help thee at all—Achilles, who bade thee,
I trow, strip the tunic from my breast, and thou
thoughtest in thy folly to do it.”</p>

<p>But Patroclus answered, “Thou boasteth much,
Hector. Yet <em>thou</em> didst not slay me, but Apollo,
who took from me my arms, for had twenty such
as thou met me, I had slain them all. And mark
thou this: death and fate are close to thee by the
hand of the great Achilles.”</p>

<p>And Hector answered (but Patroclus was dead
already), “Why dost thou prophesy death to me?
May be the great Achilles himself shall fall by
my hand.” Then he drew his spear from the
wound, and went after Automedon, to slay him,
but the swift horses of Achilles carried him away.</p>

<p>Fierce was the fight about the body of Patroclus,
and many heroes fell, both on this side and on that,
and first of them all Euphorbus, who, indeed, had
wounded him. For as he came near to strip the
dead man of his arms, Menelaus slew him with his
spear. He slew him, but took not his arms, for
Hector came through the battle; nor did Menelaus
dare to abide his coming, but went back into the
ranks of his own people. Then did Hector strip
off the arms of Patroclus, the arms which the great
Achilles had given him to wear. He laid hold
of the body, and would have dragged it into the
host of the Trojans, but Ajax Telamon came forth,
and put his broad shield before it, as a lion stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
before its cubs when the hunters meet it in the
woods, drawing down over its eyes its shaggy
brows.</p>

<p>And all the while the battle raged about the
dead Patroclus. At last Ajax said to Menelaus
(now these two had borne themselves more bravely
in the fight than all others), “See if thou canst find
Antilochus, Nestor’s son, that he may carry the
tidings to Achilles, how that Patroclus is dead.”</p>

<p>So Menelaus went and found Antilochus on the
left of the battle, and said to him, “I have ill news
for thee. Thou seest that the men of Troy have
the victory to-day. And also Patroclus lies dead.
Run, therefore, to Achilles, and tell him, if haply
he may save the body; but as for the arms, Hector
has them already.”</p>

<p>Sore dismayed was Antilochus to hear such
tidings, and his eyes were filled with tears and his
voice was choked. Yet did he give heed to the
words of Menelaus, and ran to tell Achilles of what
had chanced.</p>

<p>Antilochus came near to Achilles, who, indeed,
seeing that the Greeks fled and the men of Troy
pursued, was already sore afraid. And he said,
weeping as he spake, “I bring ill news—Patroclus
lies low. The Greeks fight for his body, but Hector
has his arms.”</p>

<p>Then Achilles took of the dust of the plain in
his hands, and poured it on his head, and lay
at his length upon the ground, and tore his hair.
And all the women wailed. And Antilochus sat
weeping; but ever he held the hands of Achilles,
lest he should slay himself in his great grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came his mother, hearing his cry, from
where she sat in the depths of the sea, and laid her
hand on him and said, “Why weepest thou, my
son? Hide not the matter from me, but tell me.”</p>

<p>And Achilles answered, “All that Jupiter
promised thee for me he hath fulfilled. But what
profit have I, for lo! my friend Patroclus is dead,
and Hector has the arms which I gave him to wear.
And as for me, I care not to live, except I can
avenge me upon him.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_DEATH_OF_HECTOR">THE DEATH OF HECTOR</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Priam stood on a tower of the wall and
saw the people flying before the attacks of
Achilles, so he hastened down to the gates and said
to the keepers, “Keep the wicket-gates open, that
the people may enter in.”</p>

<p>So the keepers held the gates open, and the
people hastened in, wearied with toil and thirst and
covered with dust, and Achilles followed close upon
them. At that hour the Greeks would have taken
the city of Troy, but that Apollo saved it by putting
courage into the heart of Antenor’s son Agenor,
and by standing by him that he should not be
slain.</p>

<p>Agenor stood thinking within himself—“Shall I
flee with these others? Achilles will take me and
slay me, and I shall die as a coward dies. What if
I stand to meet him before the gates? He, too, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
mortal man and his flesh may be pierced by the
spear.”</p>

<p>When Achilles came near he cast his spear, striking
the leg below the knee, but the armor was so
strong it turned off the spear. But when Achilles
would have slain him, lo! Apollo lifted him up and
set him within the city, and that the men of Troy
might have space to enter, he took upon him Agenor’s
shape. The false Agenor fled, and Achilles
pursued him.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the men of Troy flocked into
the city, without stopping to ask who was safe and
who was dead. Only Hector remained outside the
walls, standing in front of the great Scæan gates.
But all the while Achilles was fiercely pursuing the
false Agenor, till at last Apollo turned and spake
to him—</p>

<p>“Why dost thou pursue me, swift-footed Achilles?
Hast thus not yet found out that I am a god, and
that all thy fury is in vain? All the sons of Troy
are safe in their city, and thou art here, far out of
the way, seeking to slay me, who cannot die.”</p>

<p>In great wrath Achilles answered him, “Thou
hast done me wrong in so drawing me away from
the wall, great archer, most mischief-loving of all
the gods. Had it not been for this, many a Trojan
more had bitten the ground. Thou hast robbed me
of great glory, and saved thy favorites. O that I
had the power to take vengeance on thee! Thou
hadst paid dearly for thy cheat!”</p>

<p>Then he turned and rushed towards the city,
swift as a racehorse whirls a chariot across the plain.
Old Priam spied him from the walls, with his glittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
armor, bright as that brightest of the stars—men
call it Orion’s dog—which shines at vintage-time,
a baleful light, bringing the fevers of autumn
to men. And the old man groaned aloud when he
saw him, and stretching out his hands, cried to his
son Hector, where he stood before the gates, eager
to do battle with this dread warrior—</p>

<p>“Wait not for this man, dear son, wait not for
him, lest thou die beneath his hand, for indeed he is
stronger than thou. Wretch that he is! I would
that the gods bare such love to him as I bare! Right
soon would the dogs and vultures eat him. Of
many brave sons has he bereaved me. Two I
miss to-day—Polydorus and Lycaon. May be they
are yet alive in the host of the Greeks, and I shall
buy them back with gold, of which I have yet great
store in my house. And if they are dead, sore grief
will it be to me and to the mother who bare them;
but little will care the other sons of Troy, so that
thou fall not beneath the hand of Achilles. Come
within the walls, dear child; come to save the sons
and daughters of Troy; come in pity for me, thy
father, for whom, in my old age, an evil fate is in
store, to see sons slain with the sword, and daughters
carried into captivity, and babes dashed upon
the ground. Ay, and last of all, the dogs which I
have reared in my palace will devour me as I lie
on the threshold of my home. That a young man
should fall in battle and suffer such lot as happens
to the slain, this is to be borne; but that such dishonor
should be done to the white hair and white
beard of the old, mortal eyes can see no fouler sight
than this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus old Priam spake, but could not turn the
heart of his son. And from the wall on the other
side of the gate his mother called to him, weeping
sore, and said—</p>

<p>“Pity me, my son; think of how in the old days
I stilled thy cries. Come within the walls; wait not
for this man, nor stand in battle against him. If
he slay thee, neither I, nor thy wife, shall pay thee
the last honors of the dead, but far away by the
ships of the Greeks the dogs and vultures will devour
thee.”</p>

<p>So father and mother besought their son, but all
in vain. He was still minded to abide the coming
of Achilles. Just as in the mountains a great snake
at its hole abides the coming of a man: fierce glare
its eyes, and it coils its tail: so Hector waited for
Achilles; and as he waited he thought thus within
himself—“Woe is me if I go within the walls;
Polydamas will be the first to reproach me, for he
advised me to bring back the sons of Troy to the
city before the night when Achilles roused himself
to war. But I would not listen to him. Would
that I had! it had been much better for us; but now
I have destroyed the people by my folly. I fear
the sons and daughters of Troy, what they may
say; I fear lest some coward reproach me: ‘Hector
trusted in his strength, and lo! he has destroyed the
people.’ Better were it for me either to slay Achilles
or to fall by his hand with honor here before the
walls. Or, stay: shall I put down my shield, and
lay aside my helmet, and lean my spear against the
wall and go to meet the great Achilles, and promise
that we will give back the fair Helen, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
wealth that Paris carried off with her; ay, and render
up all the wealth that there is in the city, that
the Greeks may divide it among themselves, binding
the sons of Troy with an oath that they keep
nothing back? But this is idle talk: he will have no
shame or pity, but will slay me while I stand without
arms or armor before him. It is not for us
to talk as a youth and a maiden talk together. It
is better to meet in arms, and see whether the ruler
of Olympus will give victory to him or to me.”
Thus he thought in his heart.</p>

<p>Achilles came near, brandishing over his right
shoulder the great Pelian spear, and the flash of his
arms was as the flame of fire, or as the rising sun.
And Hector trembled when he saw him, nor dared
to abide his coming. Fast he fled from the gates,
and fast Achilles pursued him, as a hawk, fastest
of all the birds of air, pursues a dove upon the
mountains. Past the watch-tower they ran, past
the wind-blown fig-tree, along the wagon-road
which went about the walls, and they came to the
fair-flowing fountain where from two springs rises
the stream of eddying Scamander. Hot is one
spring, and a steam ever goes up from it, as from
a burning fire; and cold is the other, cold, even in
the summer heats, as hail or snow or ice. There are
fair basins of stone, where the wives and fair daughters
of Troy were wont to wash their garments, but
that was in the old days of peace, before the Greeks
came to the land. Past the springs they ran, one
flying, the other pursuing: brave was he that fled,
braver he that pursued: it was no sheep for sacrifice
or shield of ox-hide for which they ran, but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
life of Hector, the tamer of horses. Thrice they
ran round the city, and all the gods looked on.</p>

<p>And Jupiter said, “This is a piteous sight that
I behold. My heart is grieved for Hector—Hector,
who has ever worshipped me with sacrifice, sometimes
on the heights of Ida, and sometimes in the
citadel of Troy; and now the great Achilles is pursuing
him round the city of Priam. Come, ye gods,
let us take counsel together. Shall we save him
from death, or let him fall beneath the hand of
Achilles?”</p>

<p>Then Minerva said, “What is this that thou sayest,
great sire?—to rescue a man whom fate has
appointed to die? Do it, if it be thy will; but we,
the other gods, approve it not.”</p>

<p>Jupiter answered her, “My heart is unwilling;
yet I would do thee pleasure. Be it as thou wilt.”</p>

<p>Then Minerva came down in haste from the top
of Olympus, and still Hector fled and Achilles pursued,
just as a dog pursues a fawn upon the hills.
And ever Hector made for the gates, to get shelter
beneath the towers, if haply those that stood upon
them might defend him with their spears; and ever
Achilles would get before him, and drive him
towards the plain. So they ran, one making for the
city, and the other driving him to the plain. Just
as in a dream, when one seems to fly and another
seems to pursue, and the one cannot escape and the
other cannot overtake, so these two ran together.
But as for Hector, Apollo even yet helped him, and
gave him strength and nimble knees, else could he
not have held out against Achilles, who was swiftest
of foot among the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Achilles had beckoned to the Greeks that
no man should throw his spear at Hector, lest, perchance,
he should be robbed of his glory. And
when the two came in their running for the fourth
time to the springs of Scamander, Jupiter held out
the great balance of doom, and in one scale he
put the fate of Achilles, and in the other the fate
of Hector; and lo! the scale of Hector sank
down to the realms of death, and Apollo left
him.</p>

<p>Then Minerva lighted down from the air close
to Achilles and said, “This, great Achilles, is our
day of glory, for we shall slay Hector, mighty warrior
though he be. For it is his doom to die and
Apollo shall not save him. But stand thou still and
take breath, and I will give this man heart to meet
thee in battle.”</p>

<p>So Achilles stood, leaning upon his spear. And
Minerva took the shape of Deïphobus, and came
near to Hector and said—</p>

<p>“Achilles presses thee hard, my brother, pursuing
thee thus round the city of Priam. Come, let
us make a stand and encounter him.”</p>

<p>Then Hector answered him, “Deïphobus, I
always loved thee best of all my brothers; but now
I love thee yet more, for that thou alone, while all
others remained within, hast ventured forth to stand
by my side.”</p>

<p>But the false Deïphobus said, “Much did father
and mother and all my comrades beseech me to remain.
But my heart was sore troubled for thee, and
I could not stay. Let us stand and fight this man,
not stinting our spears, and see whether he shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
carry our spoil to the ships or we shall slay him
here.”</p>

<p>Then the two chiefs came near to each other, and
Hector with a waving plume spake first and said,
“Thrice, great Achilles, hast thou pursued me round
the walls of Troy, and I dared not stand up against
thee; but now I fear thee no more. Only let us
make this covenant between us: if Jupiter give me
the victory, I will do no dishonor to thy body; thy
arms and armor will I take, and give back thy
body to the Greeks; and do thou promise to do
likewise.”</p>

<p>But Achilles scowled at him and said, “Hector,
talk not of covenants to me. Men and lions make
no oaths between each other, neither is there any
agreement between wolves and sheep. So there
shall be no covenant between me and thee. One of
us two shall fall; and now is the time for thee to
show thyself a warrior, for of a truth Minerva will
slay thee by my spear, and thou shalt pay the penalty
for all my comrades whom thou hast slain.”</p>

<p>Then he threw the mighty spear, but Hector
saw it coming and avoided it, crouching on the
ground, so that the mighty spear flew above his
head and fixed itself in the earth. But Minerva
snatched it from the ground and gave it back to
Achilles, Hector not perceiving.</p>

<p>Then Hector spake to Achilles, “Thou hast
missed thy aim, great Achilles. It was no word of
Jupiter that thou spakest, prophesying my doom,
but thou soughtest to cheat me, terrifying me by
thy words. Thou shalt not drive thy steel into my
back, but here into my breast, if the gods will it so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
But now look out for my spear. Would it might
bury itself in thy flesh. The battle would be easier
for the men of Troy were thou only out of the way.”</p>

<p>And as he spake he threw his long-shafted
spear. True aim he took, for the spear struck the
very middle of Achilles’ shield. It struck, but
pierced it not, but bounded far away, for the shield
was not of mortal make. And Hector stood dismayed,
for he had not another spear, and when he
called to Deïphobus that he should give him another,
lo! Deïphobus was gone. Then Hector knew
that his end was come, and he said to himself,
“Now have the gods called me to my doom. I
thought that Deïphobus was near; but he is within
the walls, and the help which he promised me was
but a cheat with which Minerva cheated me. Jupiter
and Apollo are with me no more; but, if I must
die, let me at least die in such a deed as men of
after time may hear of.”</p>

<p>So he spake, and drew the mighty sword that
hung by his side: then, as an eagle rushes through
the clouds to pounce on a hare or a lamb, rushed
on the great Achilles. But he dealt never a blow;
for Achilles charged to meet him, his shield before
his breast, his helmet bent forward as he ran, with
the long plumes streaming behind, and the gleam
of his spear-point was as the gleam of the evening
star, which is the fairest of all the stars in heaven.
One moment he thought where he should drive it
home, for the armor which Hector had won from
Patroclus guarded him well; but one spot there
was, where by the collar-bone the neck joins the
shoulder (and nowhere is the stroke of sword or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
spear more deadly). There he drave in the spear,
and the point stood out behind the neck, and Hector
fell in the dust.</p>

<p>Then Achilles cried aloud, “Hector, thou
thoughtest in the day when thou didst spoil
Patroclus of his arms that thou wouldst be safe
from vengeance, taking, forsooth, no account of
me. And lo! thou art fallen before me.”</p>

<p>But Hector, growing faint, spake to him: “Take
the ransom, gold and bronze, that my father and
mother shall pay thee, and let the sons and
daughters of Troy give me burial rites.”</p>

<p>But Achilles scowled at him, and cried, “Dog,
seek not to entreat me! No ransom, though it were
ten times told, should buy thee back; no, not
though Priam should offer thy weight in gold.”</p>

<p>Then Hector, who was now at the point to die,
spake to him: “I know thee well, what manner of
man thou art, that the heart in thy breast is iron
only. Only beware lest some vengeance from the
gods come upon thee in the day when Paris and
Apollo shall slay thee, for all thy valor, by the
Scæan gates.”</p>

<p>So speaking, he died. But Achilles said, “Die,
hound; but my fate I meet when Jupiter and the
other gods decree.”</p>

<p>The Greeks came about the dead man, marvelling
at his stature and beauty. And one would say to
another, “Surely this Hector is less dreadful now
than in the day when he would burn our ships with
fire.”</p>

<p>Then Achilles devised a ruthless thing in his
heart. He bound the body with thongs of ox-hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to the chariot, letting the head drag behind, and
thus he dragged Hector to the ships. Priam saw
him from the walls, and scarce could his sons keep
him back, but that he should go forth and beg the
body of his dear son from him who had slain him.
And Hecuba his mother also bewailed him, but
his wife Andromaché knew not at yet of what had
befallen him. For she sat in her dwelling, wearing
a great purple mantle broidered with flowers. And
she bade her maidens make ready a bath for
Hector, when he should come back from the battle,
nor knew that he should never need it more.
But the voice of wailing from the town came to
her, and she rose up hastily in great fear, and
dropped the shuttle from her hand and called to
her maidens—</p>

<p>“Come with me, ye maidens, that I may see
what has befallen, for I heard the voice of Queen
Hecuba, and I fear me much that some evil has
come to the children of Priam. For it may be that
Achilles has run between Hector and the city, and
is pursuing him to the plain, for never will Hector
abide with the army, but will fight in the front, so
bold is he.”</p>

<p>Then she hasted through the city as if she were
mad. And when she came to the wall she stood
and looked; and lo! the horses of Achilles were
dragging Hector to the ships. Then did darkness
come on her, and she fell back fainting, and from
her fair head dropped the net and the wreath and
the diadem which golden Venus gave her on the
day when Hector of the waving plume took her
from the house of Eëtion to be his wife.</p>

<h3 id="THE_RANSOMING_OF_HECTOR">THE RANSOMING OF HECTOR</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">After a while, at the bidding of Jupiter,
Thetis went to Achilles and found him weeping
softly for his dead friend, for the strength of
his sorrow was now spent, and she said to him, “It
is the will of the gods that thou give up the body
of Hector, and take in exchange the ransom of
gold and precious things which his father will give
thee for him.”</p>

<p>And her son answered, “Be it so, if the gods will
have it.”</p>

<p>Then Jupiter sent Iris, who was his messenger,
to King Priam, where he sat with his face wrapped
in his mantle, and his sons weeping about him, and
his daughters wailing through the chambers of his
palace.</p>

<p>Then Iris spake. “Be of good cheer, Priam;
Jupiter has sent me to thee. Go, taking with thee
such gifts as may best please the heart of Achilles,
and bring back the body of thy dear son Hector.
Go without fear of death or harm, and go alone.
Only let an aged herald be with thee, to help thee
when thou bringest back the body of the dead.”</p>

<p>Then Priam rose with joy, and bade his sons
bring forth his chariot; but first he went to his
chamber, and called to Hecuba, his wife, and told
her of his purpose, nor heeded when she sought to
turn him from it, but said, “Seek not to hold me
back, nor be a bird of evil omen in my house. If
any prophet or seer had bidden me do this thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
I should have held it a deceit; but now have I
heard the very voice of the messenger of Jupiter.
Wherefore, I shall go. And if I die, what care I?
Let Achilles slay me, so that I embrace once more
the body of my son.”</p>

<p>Then he bade them put into a wagon shawls
and mantles that had never been washed, and rugs
and cloaks and tunics, twelve of each, and ten
talents of gold, and two bright three-footed
caldrons, and four basins, and a cup of great
beauty which the Thracians had given him. The
old man spared nothing that he had, if only he
might buy back his son. None of the Trojans
would he suffer to come near him. “Begone,” he
cried, “ye cowards! Have ye nothing to wail for
at home, that ye come to wail with me? Surely,
an easy prey will ye be to the Greeks, now that
Hector is dead.”</p>

<p>Then he cried with like angry words to his sons,
Paris, and Agathon, and Deïphobus, and the
others—there were nine of them in all—“Make
haste, ye evil brood. Would that ye all had died
instead of Hector. Surely an ill-fated father am
I. Many a brave son I had, as Mestor, and Troïlus,
and Hector, who was fairer than any of the sons of
men. But all these are gone, and only the cowards
are left, masters of lying words, and skilful in the
dance, and mighty to drink wine. But go, yoke the
mules to the wagon.”</p>

<p>So they yoked the mules to the wagon. But
the horses for his chariot Priam, with the herald,
yoked himself.</p>

<p>Then Hecuba came near, and bade a woman-servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
come and pour water on his hands. And
when she had poured, King Priam took a great
cup from the hands of his wife, and made a libation
to Jupiter, and prayed—“Hear me, Father
Jupiter, and grant that Achilles may pity me.
And do thou send me now a lucky sign, that I
may go with a good heart to the ships of the
Greeks.”</p>

<p>And Jupiter heard him, and sent an eagle, a
mighty bird, whose wings spread out on either side
as wide as is the door of some spacious chamber in
a rich man’s house. On his right hand it flew high
above the city, and all rejoiced when they saw the
sign.</p>

<p>Then the old man mounted his chariot in haste,
and drove forth from the palace. Before him the
mules drew the four-wheeled wagon, and these
the herald Idæus guided. But his chariot the old
king drove himself. And all his kinsfolk went with
him, weeping as for one who was going to his death.
But when they came down from the city to the
plain, Priam and the herald went towards the ships
of the Greeks, but all the others returned to Troy.</p>

<p>Jupiter saw him depart, and said to Mercury,
“Mercury, go, guide King Priam to the ships of
the Greeks, so that no man see him before he comes
to the tents of Achilles.”</p>

<p>Then Mercury fastened on his feet the fair
sandals of gold with which he flies, fast as the wind,
over sea and land, and in his hand he took the rod
with which he opens and closes, as he wills, the eyes
of men. And he flew down and lighted on the plain
of Troy, taking on him the likeness of a fair youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>When they had driven past the great tomb of
Ilus, they stopped the horses and the mules, to let
them drink of the river. And darkness came over
the land; and then the herald spied Mercury, and
said—“Consider, my lord, what we shall do. I see
a man, and I am sore afraid lest he slay us. Shall
we flee on the chariot, or shall we go near and entreat
him, that he may have pity upon us?”</p>

<p>Then the old man was sore troubled, and his hair
stood up with fear. But Mercury came near and
took him by the hand and said—“Whither goest
thou, old man, with thy horses and mules through
the darkness? Hast thou no fear of these fierce
Greeks, who are close at hand? If any one should
see thee with all this wealth, what then? And thou
art not young, nor is thy attendant young, that ye
should defend yourselves against an enemy. But I
will not harm thee, nor suffer any other, for thou
art like my own dear father.”</p>

<p>“It is well, my son,” said the old man. “Surely
one of the blessed gods is with me, in causing me
to meet such an one as thou, so fair and so wise.
Happy the parents of such a son!”</p>

<p>And Mercury said, “Come, tell me true, old man.
Are you sending away all these treasures that they
may be kept safe for you far away? Or are all the
men of Troy leaving the city, seeing now that Hector,
who was their bravest warrior, is dead?”</p>

<p>Then Priam answered, “Who art thou, my son,
and what thy race, that thou speakest so truly about
my hapless son?”</p>

<p>“Often,” said Mercury, “have I seen Hector in
the battle, both at other times, and when he drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the Greeks before him at the ships. We, indeed,
stood and watched and marvelled at him, for
Achilles would not suffer us to fight, being angry
with King Agamemnon. Now, I am a follower of
Achilles, coming from Greece in the same ship with
him. One of the Myrmidons I am, son of Polyctor,
an old man such as thou art. Six other sons he has,
and when we drew lots who should come to the war,
it fell to me. But know that with the morning the
Greeks will set their battle in array against the
city, for they are weary of their sojourn, and the
kings cannot keep them back.”</p>

<p>Then said Priam, “If they art an attendant of
Achilles, tell me true, is my son yet by the ships,
or have the dogs devoured him?”</p>

<p>And Mercury answered, “Nor dogs nor vultures
have devoured him. Still he lies by the ships of
Achilles; and though this is the twelfth day since
he was slain, no decay has touched him. Nay,
though Achilles drags him round the tomb of his
dear Patroclus, yet even so does no unseemliness
come to him. All fresh he lies, and the blood is
washed from him, and all his wounds are closed—and
many spear-points pierced him. The blessed
gods love him well, dead man though he be.”</p>

<p>This King Priam was well pleased to hear. “It
is well,” he said, “for a man to honor the gods;
for indeed, as my son never forgot the dwellers
on Olympus, so have they not forgotten him, even
in death. But do thou take this fair cup and do
kindness to him, and lead me to the tent of
Achilles.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” answered Mercury, “thou speakest this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
in vain. No gift would I take from thy hand unknown
to Achilles; for I honor him much, and
fear to rob him, lest some evil happen to me afterwards.
But thee I will guide to Argos itself, if
thou wilt, whether by land or sea, and no one shall
blame my guiding.”</p>

<p>Then he leapt into the chariot of the king and
caught the reins in his hand, and gave the horses
and the mules a strength that was not their own.
And when they came to the ditch and the trench
that guarded the ships, lo! the guards were busy
with their meals; but Mercury made sleep descend
upon them, and opened the gates and brought in
Priam with his treasures. And when they came
to the tent of Achilles, Mercury lighted down from
the chariot and said—</p>

<p>“Lo! I am Mercury, whom my father Jupiter
hath sent to be thy guide. And now I shall depart,
for I would not that Achilles should see me.
But go thou in, and clasp his knees, and beseech
him by his father and his mother and his child. So
shalt thou move his heart with pity.”</p>

<p>So Mercury departed to Olympus, and King
Priam leapt down from the chariot, leaving the
herald to care for the horses and the mules, and
went to the tent. There he found Achilles sitting;
his comrades sat apart, but two waited on
him, for he had but newly ended his meal, and the
table was yet at his hand. But no man saw King
Priam till he was close to Achilles, and he caught
his knees and kissed his hands, the dreadful murderous
hands that had slain so many of his sons.
As a man who slays another by mishap flies to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
stranger land, to some rich man’s home, and all
wonder to see him, so Achilles wondered to see
King Priam, and his comrades wondered, looking
one at another. Then King Priam spake—</p>

<p>“Think of thy father, godlike Achilles, and pity
me. He is old, as I am, and, it may be, his neighbors
trouble him, seeing that he has no defender;
yet so long as he knows that thou art alive, it is
well with him, for every day he hopes to see his dear
son return from Troy. But as for me, I am altogether
wretched. Many a valiant son I had—nineteen
born to me of one mother—and most of them
are dead, and he that was the best of all, who kept
our city safe, he has been slain by thee. He it is
whom I have come to ransom. Have pity on him
and on me, thinking of thy father. Never, surely,
was lot so sad as this, to kiss the hands that slew
a son.”</p>

<p>The words so stirred the heart of Achilles that
he wept, thinking now of Patroclus, and now of
his old father at home; and Priam wept, thinking
of his dead Hector. But at last Achilles stood up
from his seat and raised King Priam, having pity
on his white hair and his white beard, and spake—</p>

<p>“How didst thou dare to come to the ships of
the Greeks, to the man who slew thy sons? Surely
thou must have a heart of iron. But sit thou down:
let our sorrows rest in our hearts, for there is no
profit in lamentation. It is the will of the gods
that men should suffer woe, but they are themselves
free from care. Two chests are set by the side of
Father Jupiter, one of good and one of evil gifts,
and he mixes the lot of men, taking out of both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Many noble gifts did the gods give to King Peleus,
my father; wealth and bliss beyond that of other
men, and kingship over the Myrmidons. Ay! and
they gave him a goddess to be his wife. But they
gave also this evil, that he had no stock of stalwart
children in his house, but one son only, and I cannot
help him at all in his old age, for I tarry here far
away in Troy. Thou, too, old man, hadst wealth
and power of old, and lordship over all that lies
between Lesbos and Phrygia and the stream of
Hellespont. And to thee the gods have given this
ill, that there is ever battle and slaughter about thy
city walls. But as for thy son, wail not for him,
for thou canst not raise him up.”</p>

<p>But Priam answered, “Make me not to sit, great
Achilles, while Hector lies unhonored. Let me
ransom him, and look upon him with my eyes, and
do thou take the gifts. And the gods grant thee
to return safe to thy fatherland.”</p>

<p>But Achilles frowned and said, “Vex me not; I
am minded myself to give thee back thy Hector.
My mother came from the sea, bearing the bidding
of Jupiter and thou, methinks, hast not come
hither without some guidance from the gods. But
trouble me no more, lest I do thee some hurt.”</p>

<p>And King Priam feared and held his peace.
Then Achilles hastened from his tent, and two
comrades with him. First they loosed the horses
from the chariot and the mules from the wagon;
then they brought in the herald Idæus, and took
the gifts. Only they left of them two cloaks and
a tunic, wherein they might wrap the dead. And
Achilles bade the women wash and anoint the body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
but away from the tent, lest perchance Priam
should see his son and cry aloud, and so awaken
the fury in his heart. But when it was washed and
anointed, Achilles himself lifted it in his arms and
put it on the litter, and his comrades lifted the litter
on the wagon.</p>

<p>And when all was finished, Achilles groaned and
cried to his dead friend, saying—</p>

<p>“Be not wroth, Patroclus, if thou shouldst hear
in the unknown land that I have ransomed Hector
to his father: a noble ransom hath he paid me, and
of this, too, thou shalt have thy share.”</p>

<p>Then he went back to his tent, and set himself
down opposite Priam, and spake: “Thy son is
ransomed, old man, and to-morrow shalt thou see
him and take him back to Troy. But now let us
eat. Did not Niobe eat when she lost her twelve
children, six daughters and six sons, whom Apollo
and Diana slew because she likened herself to the
fair Latona? So let us eat, old man. To-morrow
shalt thou weep for Hector; many tears, I trow,
shall be shed for him.”</p>

<p>So they ate and drank. And when the meal was
ended, Achilles sat and marvelled at King Priam’s
noble look, and King Priam marvelled at Achilles,
so strong he was and fair.</p>

<p>Then Priam said, “Let me sleep, great Achilles.
I have not slept since my son fell by thy hand.
Now I have eaten and drunk, and my eyes are
heavy.”</p>

<p>So the comrades of Achilles made him a bed
outside, where no one might see him, should it
chance that any of the chiefs should come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
tent of Achilles to take counsel, and should espy
him, and tell it to King Agamemnon.</p>

<p>But before he slept King Priam said, “If thou
art minded to let me bury Hector, let there be a
truce between my people and the Greeks. For
nine days let us mourn for Hector, and on the
tenth will we bury him and feast the people, and
on the eleventh raise a great tomb above him, and
on the twelfth we will fight again, if fight we
must.”</p>

<p>And Achilles answered, “Be it so: I will stay
the war for so long.”</p>

<p>But while Priam slept there came to him Mercury,
the messenger of Jupiter, and said: “Sleepest
thou, Priam, among thy foes? Achilles has
taken ransom for thy Hector; but thy sons that
are left would pay thrice as much for thee should
Agamemnon hear that thou wert among the ships.”</p>

<p>The old man heard and trembled, and roused
the herald, and the two yoked the horses and the
mules. So they passed through the army, and no
man knew. And when they came to the river,
Mercury departed to Olympus, and the morning
shone over all the earth. Wailing and weeping,
they carried the body to the city.</p>

<p>It was Cassandra who first espied them as they
came. Her father she saw, and the herald, and
then the dead body on the litter, and she cried,
“Sons and daughters of Troy, go to meet Hector,
if ever ye have met him, with joy as he came back
from the battle.”</p>

<p>And straightway there was not man or woman
left in the city. They met the wagon when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
close to the gates; his wife led the way, and his
mother and all the multitude followed. And in
truth they would have kept it thus till evening,
weeping and wailing, but King Priam spake—“Let
us pass; ye shall have enough of wailing when
we have taken him to his home.”</p>

<p>So they took him to his home and laid him on
his bed. And the minstrels lamented, and the
women wailed.</p>

<p>Then first of all came Andromaché, his wife, and
cried—“O my husband, thou hast perished in thy
youth, and I am left in widowhood, and our child,
thy child and mine, is but an infant. I fear me he
will not grow to manhood. Ere that day this city
will fall, for thou art gone who wast its defender.
Soon will they carry us away, mothers and children,
in the ships, and thou, my son, perchance wilt
be with us, and serve the stranger in unseemly
bondage; or, it may be, some Greek will slay thee,
seizing thee and dashing thee from the wall; some
Greek whose brother, or father, or son, Hector has
slain in the battle. Many a Greek did Hector slay;
no gentle hand was his in the fray. Therefore do
the people wail for him to-day. Sore is thy parents’
grief, O Hector, but sorest mine. Thou didst
stretch no hands of farewell to me from thy bed,
nor speak any word of comfort for me to muse on
while I weep night and day.”</p>

<p>Next spake Hecuba, his mother. “Dear wast
thou, my son, in life to the immortal gods, and dear
in death. Achilles dragged thee about the tomb
of his dear Patroclus, but could not bring him back,
and now thou liest fresh and fair as one whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the god of the silver bow has slain with sudden
stroke.”</p>

<p>And last of all came Helen, and cried, “Many
a year has passed since I came to Troy—would
that I had died before! And never have I heard
from thy lips one bitter word, and if ever husband’s
sister, or sister-in-law, or mother-in-law—for Priam
was ever gentle as a father—spake harshly to me,
thou wouldst check them with thy grace and gracious
words. Therefore I weep for thee; no one is
left to be my friend in all the broad streets of Troy.
All shun and hate me now.”</p>

<p>And all the people wailed reply.</p>

<p>Then Priam spake. “Go, my people, gather
wood for the burial, and fear not any ambush of
the Greeks, for Achilles promised that he would
stay the war until the twelfth day should come.”</p>

<p>So for nine days the people gathered much wood,
and on the tenth they laid Hector upon the pile,
and lit fire beneath it. And when it was burnt they
quenched the embers with wine. Then his brethren
and comrades gathered together the white bones,
and laid them in a chest of gold; and this they
covered with purple robes and put in a great coffin,
and laid upon it stones many and great. And over
all they raised a mighty mound; and all the while
the watchers watched, lest the Greeks should arise
and slay them. Last of all was a great feast held
in the palace of King Priam.</p>

<p>So they buried Hector, the tamer of horses.</p>

<h3 id="THE_WOODEN_HORSE">THE WOODEN HORSE</h3>

<p class="author">By Grace Bigelow Patten</p>

<p class="dropcap">For nine long years the Greeks besieged Troy,
but for all their plans and manœuvres the city
held out against them. They pillaged and overran
the neighboring towns but Troy stood fast.</p>

<p>Never were brave men pitted against a braver
enemy. The lives of many heroes were sacrificed,
Hector’s, the greatest of the Trojan champions,
and the valiant Achilles among them, at whose loss
the Greeks almost despaired. Force had failed.
Their leader had fallen. They must outwit their
enemy. With the aid of Ulysses they worked out
an admirable plan.</p>

<p>Down came the tents of the main body of the
army, there was clatter and jangle of departure
and the Greeks swept down the slope to the sea and
their ships, as though homeward bound. Afloat,
they soon sailed out of sight behind a neighboring
island and came to anchor.</p>

<p>The remainder of the army set to work with a
will to build a gigantic wooden horse, his sides
planked with pine, a huge, hollow horse, as full of
peek holes as a colander and with ample room for a
band of men to lie hidden within. When it was
finished, Ulysses, Menelaus, Pyrrhus and a company
of armed warriors entered the horse by means
of a secret door and the remainder of the Grecian
army sailed away.</p>

<p>On seeing them depart, the Trojans believed the
Greeks had at last lost heart, and, with victorious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
headlong delight they burst through the gates and
swarmed over the plain into the abandoned camp.
Looming down on them stood the great horse.
Approaching it first with caution, they soon grew
bolder and youths and maidens joined hands and
danced around it. Many urged that it be drawn
into the city. Others were afraid and said, “Burn
it, sink it into the sea.” The priest Laocoön begged
them to have nothing to do with it. “Are you mad?
Have you not learned enough of Grecian fraud
to be on your guard against it? For my part, I
fear the Greeks even when they offer gifts.” With
that he threw his great spear at the horse’s side,
which gave forth a hollow sound.</p>

<p>At that moment there was an outcry, as some
herdsmen brought before the chiefs a miserable,
sullen-looking man whose hands were bound behind
his back. He seemed to be the sole survivor
of the Grecian army. With the assurance that
his life would be spared if he spoke the truth, he
tremblingly told them of his sufferings; that he
was Sinon, a Greek, who, because of some grudge
of Ulysses had been condemned to die as a sacrifice
to the gods, of his escape and of his having hidden
all night in a weedy lake and until his people
were well at sea. All hearts warmed to him. The
king ordered his hands unbound and bade him
forget the Greeks and “be one of us.” “But tell
me,” said the king, “why did you build this great
horse?” The treacherous Sinon replied, “That is
an offering to Minerva and made so huge to prevent
its being carried into the city, for Calchas, the
prophet, told us that if the Trojans took possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of it they would surely triumph over the
Greeks.” Hearing this, the people were overjoyed,
and, in spite of Laocoön’s pleading, began to plan
how they might drag the horse into the city. Suddenly
a shudder went through the crowd. Out
from the surf tumbling along the beach, appeared
two immense serpents; breast to breast, on they
came, with heads reared high, hissing jaws and
blazing blood-red eyes. Many fled in terror.
Some were transfixed and stood with haggard faces
as the great creatures swept up to Laocoön and his
two young sons, enfolded them in their hideous
coils, crushed them to earth, devoured them, then
glided on to the citadel of Minerva and slipped
beneath the feet of the goddess. Here was their
omen! “The priest Laocoön has been judged
according to his deeds!” they said, “for he cast his
spear against this holy thing, and now the gods
have slain him!” They at once began making a
great opening in the wall. Hoisting levers were
adjusted, wheels fastened to the great feet, and
after wreathing the horse with green branches and
flowers they began tugging and pushing it over the
plain and into the city.</p>

<p>The day was given over to merrymaking and
feasting; so secure did they feel that the great
gates were left unguarded and that night while
they slept deeply, care free for the first time in
ten years, Sinon, the spy, unlocked the hidden door
of the great horse. Cautiously, Ulysses, Menelaus
and their men crept out, opened the gates of the
city and gave the signal to their army. Silently
the ships drew up and anchored and an armed multitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
poured out into the night. Spears clashed,
torches flared as the Greeks went plunging through
the city in a hot frenzy of triumph. King Priam
and many of his followers fell by the sword.
Houses were ransacked of their jewels, golden
bowls taken from the altars. The city was stripped
of its treasures and then burned to its foundations.
Sinon with his tale of suffering and false tears had
touched the hearts of the Trojans and accomplished
by strategy what a thousand ships and ten
years’ siege had failed to do.</p>

<h3 id="THE_LOTUS-EATERS">THE LOTUS-EATERS</h3>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">Among the chiefs of the Greeks who fought
before the walls of Troy, there was none
who gained for himself a greater glory than Ulysses
the son of Laertes.</p>

<p>Brave he was in battle, and steadfast in danger;
but most of all did the Greeks seek his aid and
counsel, when great things must be weighed and
fixed. In every peril where there was need of the
wise heart and the ready tongue, all hastened to
Ulysses, and men felt that he did more to throw
down the kingdom of Priam than the mightiest
chieftains who fought only with sword and
spear.</p>

<p>Yet, in the midst of all his toil and all his great
exploits, the heart of Ulysses was far away in rocky
Ithaca, where his wife Penelope dwelt with his
young son Telemachus. Many a time, as the weary
years of the war rolled on, he said within himself,
“Ah, when will the strife be ended, and when shall
we spread our sails to the breeze, and speed on our
way homewards?”</p>

<p>At last the doom of Paris was accomplished, and
the hosts of Agamemnon gave the city of Troy to
fire and sword. Then Ulysses hastened to gather
his men together, that they might go to their home
in Ithaca; and they dragged the ships down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
sea from the trenches where they had so long lain
idle.</p>

<p>But before they sat down to row the ship out to
the deep water, Ulysses spake to them and said,
“O friends, think now, each one of you, of his home,
of his wife, and of his children. Ten times have
summer and winter passed over us since we left
them with cheerful hearts, thinking that in but a
little time we should come back to them laden with
glory and booty. Ten years have they mourned
for us at home; and we, who set out for Troy in
the vigor of our manhood, go back now with gray
hairs, or bowed down with weary labor. Yet faint
not, O friends, neither be dismayed. Think how
they wait and long for you still at home, as we
go from land to land in our voyage to rocky Ithaca,
let not weariness weigh down your hearts, or things
fair and beautiful lead you to seek for rest, till our
ships are moored in the haven which we left ten
years ago.”</p>

<p>With shouts of joy they sat down to their long
oars; and when they had rowed the ships out into
the open sea, they spread the white sails to the
breeze, and watched the Ilian land as it faded away
from their sight in the far distance.</p>

<p>For many a day they went towards the land of
the setting sun, until a mighty wind from the north
drove them to a strange country far out of their
course to Ithaca. Fair it was and peaceful beyond
all lands which they had seen. The sun looked
down out of the cloudless heaven on fruits and
flowers which covered the laughing earth. Far
away beyond the lotus plains the blue hills glimmered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
in a dreamy haze. The trees bowed their
heads in a peaceful slumber; and the lagging waves
sank lazily to sleep upon the seashore. The summer
breeze breathed its gentle whisper through the
air, and the birds sang listlessly of their loves from
the waving groves. Then said the men of Ulysses
to one another, “Would that our wives and our
children were here! Truly Ithaca is but a rough
and barren land, and a sore grief it is to leave this
happy shore to go home, and there find, it may be,
that our children remember us no more.”</p>

<p>And Ulysses said within himself, “Surely some
strange spell is on this fair land; almost might I
long to sit down and sleep on the shore for ever;
but Penelope waits for me in my home, and I cannot
rest till I see her face once more.”</p>

<p>Then he bade three of his men go forth and ask
the name of the land and of the men who lived in
it. So they went slowly from the beach where the
waves sang their lulling song to the sleepy flowers;
and they wandered along the winding stream which
came from the glimmering hills far away, till, deep
down in a glen where the sun shed but half its light,
they saw men and maidens under the shade of
pleasant palm-trees. Before them was spread a
banquet of rich and rosy fruit, and some were eating,
and others lay asleep.</p>

<p>The men of Ulysses went up to them, and sat
down by their side, for they feared them not, as
men are wont to fear the people of a strange land.
They asked not their name, for they remembered
not the bidding of Ulysses; but they drank the
dark wine and ate of the rosy fruit which the fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
maidens held out to them. “Eat,” they said, “O
strangers, of the fruit which kills all pain: surely
ye are weary and your hearts are faint with sorrow,
and your eyes are dim as with many tears. Eat of
our fruit and forget your labors; for all who eat
of it remember no more weary toil and strife and
war.” So they ate of the fruit, and then over their
senses stole softly a strange and wondrous sleep,
so that they saw and heard and spake even while
they slumbered. On their ears fell the echo of a
dreamy music, and forms of maidens, fair as Venus
when she rose from the sea foam, passed before
their eyes; and they said one to another, “Here let
us sit, and feast, and dream for ever.”</p>

<p>Long time Ulysses waited on the seashore, and
less and less he marvelled that they came not back,
for he felt that over his own heart the strange spell
was falling: and he said, “Ah, Penelope, dearer to
me than aught else on the wide earth, the gods envy
me thy love; else would they not seek to beguile me
thus in this strange land of dreams and slumber.”</p>

<p>He rose up, as one rises to go forth to battle, and
went quickly on the path by which his men had
gone before him. Presently he saw them in the
deep dell, and the rich fruit of the lotus was in
their hand. They called to Ulysses and said, “We
have come to the land of the Lotus-eaters; sit thou
down with us and eat of their fruit, and forget all
thy cares for ever.”</p>

<p>But Ulysses answered not; and hastening back,
he bade the others come with him and bind the three
men, and carry them to the ship. “Heed not the
people of the land,” he said, “nor touch their rosy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
fruit. It were a shame for men who have fought
at Troy to slumber here like swine fattening for the
slaughter.”</p>

<p>So they hastened and bound the three men who
sat at the banquet of the Lotus-eaters; and they
heeded not their words as they besought them to
taste of the fruit and forget all their misery and
trouble. And Ulysses hurried them back to the
shore and made them drag down the ships into the
sea and sit down to their long oars. “Hasten,
friends, hasten,” he said, “from this land of dreams.
Hither come the Lotus-eaters, and their soft voices
will beguile our hearts if we tarry longer. They
will tempt us to taste of their fruit; and then we
shall seek no more to go back again to the land of
toiling men.”</p>

<p>The dash of their oars broke the calm of the still
air, and roused the waters from their slumber, as
they toiled on their weary way.</p>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">When the blue hills of the Lotus-land had
faded away in the far distance, the ships of
Ulysses went on merrily with a fresh breeze: and
the men thought that they would soon come to
rocky Ithaca, where their homes were. But Minerva
was angry with Ulysses, and she asked Neptune,
the lord of the sea, to send a great storm and
scatter his ships. So the wind arose, and the waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of the sea began to heave and swell, and the sky
was black with clouds and rain.</p>

<p>Many days and many nights the storm raged
fiercely; and when it was over, Ulysses could only
see four or five of all the ships which had sailed with
him from Troy. The ships were drenched with
the waves which had broken over them, and the men
were wet and cold and tired; and they were glad
indeed when they saw an island far away. So they
sat down on the benches, and took the great oars
and rowed the ships towards the shore; and as they
came near, they saw that the island was very beautiful
with cliffs and rocks, and bays for ships to take
shelter from the sea.</p>

<p>They rowed into one of these quiet bays, where
the water was always calm, and where there was
no need to let down an anchor, or to tie the ship by
ropes to the seashore, for the ship lay there quite
still of itself. At the head of the bay a stream of
fresh water trickled down from the cliffs, and ran
close to the opening of a large cave, and near the
cave some willow trees drooped their branches over
the stream which ran down towards the sea.</p>

<p>So they made haste to go on shore; and when
they had landed, they saw fine large plains on
which corn might grow, but no one had taken the
trouble to sow the seed; and sloping hills for the
grapes to ripen on the vines, but none were planted
on them. Ulysses marvelled at the people who
lived there, because they had no corn and no vines,
and he could see no houses, but only sheep and
goats feeding on the hill-sides. So he took his bows
and arrows, and shot many of the goats, and he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
his men lay down on the ground and had a merry
meal. When they had finished they fell asleep,
and did not wake up till the morning showed its
rosy light in the eastern sky.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses said that he would take some of his
men and go to see who lived on the island, while the
others remained in the ship close to the seashore.
So they set out, and at last they came to the mouth
of a great cave, where many sheep and goats were
penned up in large folds. They could see no one
in the cave or anywhere near it; and they waited a
long while, but no one came. They lit a fire, and
made themselves merry, as they ate the cheese and
drank the milk which was stored up round the sides
of the cave.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a great noise of heavy feet
stamping on the ground. They were so frightened
that they ran inside the cave, and crouched down at
the end of it. Nearer and nearer came the Cyclops,
and his tread almost made the earth shake. In he
came, with many dry logs of wood on his back;
and in came all the sheep, which he milked every
evening; but the rams and the goats stayed outside.
But if Ulysses and his men were afraid when they
saw Polyphemus the Cyclops come in, they were
much more afraid when he took up a great stone,
which was almost as big as the mouth of the cave,
and set it up against it for a door.</p>

<p>Then the men whispered to Ulysses and said,
“Did we not beg and pray you not to come into
the cave? But you would not listen to us; and now
how are we to get out again? Why, two-and-twenty
wagons would not be able to take away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
that huge stone from the mouth of the cave.” They
were shut in now, and there was no use in thinking
of their folly for coming in.</p>

<p>So there they lay, crouching in the corner of the
cave, and trembling with fear lest Polyphemus
should see them. But the Cyclops went on milking
the sheep, then he put the milk into the bowls round
the sides of the cave, and lit the fire to cook his
meal. As the flames shot up from the burning
wood to the roof of the cave, it showed him the
forms of Ulysses and his companions, where they
lay huddled together in the corner. He cried out
to them with a loud voice, “Who are you that dare
to come into the cave of Polyphemus? Are you
come to rob me of my sheep, or my cheese and milk
that I keep here?”</p>

<p>Then Ulysses said, “No; we are not come to do
you harm: we are Greeks, who have been fighting
at Troy to bring back Helen whom Paris stole
away from Sparta, and we went there with the
great king Agamemnon, whom everybody knows.
We are on our way home to Ithaca; but Neptune
sent a great storm, because Minerva was angry
with me; and almost all our ships have been sunk
in the sea, or broken to pieces on the rocks.”</p>

<p>When he had finished speaking, Polyphemus
frowned savagely and said, “I know nothing of
Agamemnon, or Paris, or Helen;” and he seized
two of the men, and broke their heads against the
stones, and cooked them for his dinner.</p>

<p>That day Polyphemus ate a huge meal, and
drank several bowls full of milk; and after that he
fell fast asleep. As he lay there snoring in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
heavy sleep, Ulysses thought how easy it would be
to plunge the sword into his breast, and kill him.
He was just going to do it, when he thought of the
great stone which Polyphemus had placed at the
mouth of the cave; and he knew that if Polyphemus
were killed no one else could move away the stone,
and so they would all die shut up in that dismal
place.</p>

<p>So the hours of the night went wearily on.
Neither Ulysses nor his friends could sleep, for
they thought of the men whom Polyphemus had
eaten, and how they would very likely be eaten up
themselves. At last they could tell, from the dim
light which came in between the top of the stone
and the roof of the cave, that the morning was
come. Soon Polyphemus awoke and milked all
the sheep again. When he had done this, he went
to the end of the cave, and took up two more men
and killed and ate them. Then he took down the
great stone from the mouth of the cave, and drove
all the cattle out to graze on the soft grass on the
hills; and Ulysses began to hope that they might
be able to get away before Polyphemus came back.
But the Cyclops was not so silly as to let them go,
for, as soon as the cattle were gone out, he took up
the huge stone again as easily as if it had been a
pebble, and put it up against the mouth of the cave;
and there were Ulysses and his friends shut up
again as fast as ever.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses began to think more and more how
they were to get away, for if they stayed there they
would soon be all killed, if Polyphemus went on
eating four of them every day. At last, near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
sheepfold, he saw a club which Polyphemus was
going to use as a walking-stick. It was the whole
trunk of an olive-tree, fresh and green, for he had
only just cut it and left it to dry, that he might
carry it about when it was fit for use. There it lay
like the mast of a ship, which twenty men could
hardly have lifted. Ulysses cut off a bit from the
end, as much as a man could carry, and told the
men to bring it to a very sharp point; and when
they had done this he hardened it in the fire, and
then hid it away till Polyphemus should come
home.</p>

<p>By and by, when the sun was sinking, they heard
the terrible tramp of his feet and felt the earth
shake beneath his tread. The great stone was taken
away from the mouth of the cave, and in he came,
driving the sheep and goats and the rams also
before him, for this time he let nothing stay outside.
He milked the sheep and the goats, as he had done
the day before; and then killed two more men, and
began to eat them for his supper.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses went towards him with a bottle
full of wine, and said, “Drink this wine, Polyphemus;
it will make your supper taste much nicer; I
have brought it to you because I want you to do
me some kindness in return.” So the Cyclops
stretched out his hand to take the wine, and he
drank it off greedily and asked for more. “Give
me more of this honey-sweet wine,” he said; “surely
no grapes on this earth could ever give such wine
as this: tell me your name, for I should like to do
you a kindness for giving me such wine as this.”
Then Ulysses said, “O Cyclops, I hope you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
not forget to give me what you have promised: my
name is Nobody.” And Polyphemus said, “Very
well, I shall eat up Nobody last of all, when I have
eaten up all his companions; and this is the kindness
which I mean to do for him.” By this time
he was so stupid with all he had been eating and
drinking, that he could say no more, but fell on
his back fast asleep; and his heavy snoring sounded
through the whole of the cave.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses cried to his friends, “Now is the
time; come and help me, and we will punish this
Cyclops for all that he has done.” So he took the
piece of the olive-tree, which had been made sharp,
and put it into the fire, till it almost burst into a
flame, and he and two of his men went and stood
over Polyphemus, and pushed the burning wood
into his great eye as hard and as far down as they
could. It was a terrible sight to see; but the Cyclops
was so stupid and heavy in sleep that at first
he could scarcely stir. Presently he gave a great
groan, so that Ulysses and his people started back
in a fright, and crouched down at the end of the
cave: and then the Cyclops put out his hand, drew
the burning wood from his eye, and threw it from
him in a rage, and roared out for help to his friends,
who lived on the hills round about.</p>

<p>His roar was as deep and loud as the roar of
twenty lions; and the other Cyclopes wondered when
they heard him shouting out so loud, and they said,
“What can be the matter with Polyphemus? We
never heard him make such a noise before: let us
go and see if he wants any help.” So they went to
the cave, and stood outside the great stone which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
shut it in, listening to his terrible bellowings; and
when they did not stop they shouted to him, and
asked him what was the matter. “Why have you
waked us up in the middle of the night with all
this noise, when we were sleeping comfortably? Is
any one taking away your sheep and goats, or killing
you by craft and force?”</p>

<p>And Polyphemus said, “Nobody, my friends, is
killing me by craft and force.”</p>

<p>When the others heard this they were angry,
and said, “Well, then, if nobody is killing you, why
do you roar so? If you are ill, you must bear it as
best you can, and ask our father Neptune to make
you well again;” and then they walked off to their
beds, and left Polyphemus to make as much noise
as he pleased.</p>

<p>It was of no use that he went on shouting. No
one came to him any more; and Ulysses laughed
because he had tricked him so cunningly by calling
himself Nobody. Polyphemus got up at last,
moaning and groaning with the dreadful pain, and
groped his way with his hands against the sides of
the cave until he came to the door. Then he took
down the great stone, and sat with his arms
stretched out wide; and he said to himself, “Now
I shall be sure to catch them, for no one can get out
without passing me.”</p>

<p>But Ulysses was too clever for him yet; for he
went quietly, and fastened the great rams of Polyphemus
together with long bands of willow. He
tied them together by threes, and under the stomach
of the middle one he tied one of his men, until he
had fastened them all up safely. Then he went and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
caught hold of the largest ram of all, and clung on
with his hands to the thick wool underneath his
stomach; and so they waited in a great fright, lest
after all the giant might catch and kill them.</p>

<p>At last the pale light of the morning came into
the eastern sky, and very soon the sheep and the
goats began to go out of the cave. Polyphemus
passed his hands over the backs of all the sheep as
they went by, but he did not feel the willow bands,
because their wool was long and thick, and he never
thought that any one would be tied up underneath
their stomachs. Last of all came the great ram to
which Ulysses was clinging. When Polyphemus
passed his hand over his back, he stroked him gently
and said, “Is there something the matter with you
too, as there is with your master? You were always
the first to go out of the cave, and now to-day for
the first time you are the last. I am sure that that
horrible Nobody is at the bottom of all this. Ah,
old ram, perhaps it is that you are sorry for your
master, whose eye Nobody has put out. I wish you
could speak like a man, and tell me where he is.
If I could but catch him, I would take care that he
never got away again, and then I should have some
comfort for all the evil which Nobody has done
me.” So he sent the ram on; and when he had gone
a little way from the cave, Ulysses got up from under
the ram, and went and untied all his friends, and
very glad they were to be free once more, although
they could not help grieving, when they thought
of the men whom Polyphemus had killed. But
Ulysses told them to make haste and drive as many
of the sheep and goats as they could to the ships.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
So they drove them down to the shore and hurried
them into the ships, and began to row away; and
soon they would have been out of the reach of the
Cyclops, if Ulysses could only have held his tongue.</p>

<p>He was so angry himself, that he thought he
would like to make Polyphemus still more angry;
so he shouted to him, “Cruel Cyclops, did you
think that you would not be punished for eating
up my friends? Is this the way in which you receive
strangers who have been tossed about by
many storms upon the sea?”</p>

<p>Then Polyphemus was more furious than ever,
and he broke off a great rock from the mountain,
and hurled it at Ulysses. On it came whizzing
through the air, and fell just in front of his ship,
and the water was dashed up all over it; and there
was a great heaving of the sea, which almost carried
them back to the land. They began to row again
with all their might; but still, when they had got
about twice as far as they were before, Ulysses
could not help shouting out a few more words to
Polyphemus. So he said, “If any one asks you
how you lost your eye, remember, mighty Cyclops,
to say that you were made blind by Ulysses, the
plunderer of cities, the son of Laertes, who lives
in Ithaca.”</p>

<p>Terrible indeed was the fury of Polyphemus
when he heard this, and he said: “Now I remember
how the wise Telemus used to tell me that a man
would come here named Ulysses, who would put
my eye out. But I thought he would have been
some great strong man, almost as big as myself;
and this is a miserable little wretch, whom I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
almost hold in my hand if I caught him. But stay,
and I will show you how I thank you for your kindness,
and I will ask my father Neptune to send you
a pleasant storm to toss you about upon the dark
sea.”</p>

<p>Then Polyphemus took up a bigger rock than
ever, and hurled it high into the air with all his
might. But this time it fell just behind the ship
of Ulysses: up rose the water and drenched Ulysses
and all his people, and almost sank the ship
under the sea. But it only sent them further out
of the reach of the Cyclops; and though he hurled
more rocks after them, they now fell far behind in
the sea, and did them no harm.</p>

<p>Even when they had rowed a long way, they
could still see Polyphemus standing on the high
cliff, and shaking his hands at them in rage and
pain. But no one came to help him for all his
shouting because he had told his friends that Nobody
was doing him harm.</p>

<h3 id="CIRCES_PALACE">CIRCE’S PALACE</h3>

<p class="author">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</p>

<p class="dropcap">At one time in the course of his weary voyage,
Ulysses arrived at an island that looked very
green and pleasant, but the name of which was unknown
to him. For, only a little while before he
came thither, he had met with a terrible hurricane,
or rather a great many hurricanes at once, which
drove his fleet of vessels into a strange part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
sea, where neither himself nor any of his mariners
had ever sailed.</p>

<p>This misfortune was entirely owing to the foolish
curiosity of his shipmates, who, while Ulysses lay
asleep, had untied some very bulky leathern bags,
in which they supposed a valuable treasure to be
concealed. But in each of these stout bags, King
Æolus, the ruler of the winds, had tied up a tempest
and had given it to Ulysses to keep, in order that
he might be sure of a favorable passage homeward
to Ithaca; and when the strings were loosened,
forth rushed the whistling blasts, like air out of a
blown bladder, whitening the sea with foam, and
scattering the vessels nobody could tell whither.</p>

<p>Immediately after escaping from this peril, a
still greater one had befallen him. Scudding before
the hurricane, he reached a place, which, as he afterwards
found, was called Læstrygonia, where some
monstrous giants had eaten up many of his companions
and had sunk every one of his vessels,
except that in which he himself sailed, by flinging
great masses of rock at them from the cliffs along
the shore. After going through such troubles as
these, you cannot wonder that King Ulysses was
glad to moor his tempest-beaten bark in a quiet
cove of the green island, which I began with telling
you about. But he had encountered so many
dangers from giants, and one-eyed Cyclopes, and
monsters of the sea and land, that he could not help
dreading some mischief, even in this pleasant and
seemingly solitary spot. For two days, therefore,
the poor weather-worn voyagers kept quiet, and
either stayed on board of their vessel, or merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
crept along under the cliffs that bordered the shore;
and to keep themselves alive, they dug shell-fish
out of the sand, and sought for any little rill of
fresh water that might be running towards the sea.</p>

<p>Before the two days were spent, they grew very
weary of this kind of life; for the followers of King
Ulysses, as you will find it important to remember,
were great eaters, and pretty sure to grumble if
they missed their regular meals, and their irregular
ones besides. Their stock of provisions was quite
exhausted, and even the shell-fish began to get
scarce, so that they had now to choose between
starving to death or venturing into the interior of
the island, where perhaps some huge three-headed
dragon, or other horrible monster, had his den.
Such misshapen creatures were very numerous in
those days; and nobody ever expected to make a
voyage, or take a journey, without running more
or less risk of being devoured by them.</p>

<p>But King Ulysses was a bold man as well as a
prudent one; and on the third morning he determined
to discover what sort of a place the island
was, and whether it were possible to obtain a supply
of food for the hungry mouths of his companions.
So, taking a spear in his hand, he clambered to the
summit of a cliff, and gazed round about him. At
a distance, towards the center of the island, he beheld
the stately towers of what seemed to be a
palace, built of snow-white marble, and rising in
the midst of a grove of lofty trees. The thick
branches of these trees stretched across the front
of the edifice, and more than half concealed it, although
from the portion which he saw, Ulysses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
judged it to be spacious and exceedingly beautiful,
and probably the residence of some great nobleman
or prince. A blue smoke went curling up from
the chimney, and was almost the pleasantest part
of the spectacle to Ulysses. For, from the abundance
of this smoke, it was reasonable to conclude
that there was a good fire in the kitchen, and that,
at dinner-time, a plentiful banquet would be served
up to the inhabitants of the palace, and to whatever
guests might happen to drop in.</p>

<p>With so agreeable a prospect before him, Ulysses
fancied that he could not do better than to go
straight to the palace gate, and tell the master of it
that there was a crew of poor shipwrecked mariners,
not far off, who had eaten nothing for a day
or two, save a few clams and oysters, and would
therefore be thankful for a little food. And the
prince or nobleman must be a very stingy curmudgeon,
to be sure, if at least, when his own dinner
was over, he would not bid them welcome to
the broken victuals from the table.</p>

<p>Pleasing himself with this idea, King Ulysses
had made a few steps in the direction of the palace,
when there was a great twittering and chirping
from the branch of a neighboring tree. A moment
afterwards, a bird came flying towards him,
and hovered in the air, so as almost to brush his
face with its wings. It was a very pretty little
bird, with purple wings and body, and yellow legs,
and a circle of golden feathers round his neck, and
on its head a golden tuft, which looked like a king’s
crown in miniature. Ulysses tried to catch the bird.
But it fluttered nimbly out of his reach, still chirping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
in a piteous tone, as if it could have told a
lamentable story, had it only been gifted with
human language. And when he attempted to drive
it away, the bird flew no farther than the bough
of the next tree, and again came fluttering about
his head, with its doleful chirp, as soon as he showed
a purpose of going forward.</p>

<p>“Have you anything to tell me, little bird?”
asked Ulysses.</p>

<p>And he was ready to listen attentively to whatever
the bird might communicate; for, at the siege
of Troy, and elsewhere, he had known such odd
things to happen, that he would not have considered
it much out of the common run had this little feathered
creature talked as plainly as himself.</p>

<p>“Peep!” said the bird, “peep, peep, pe—weep!”
And nothing else would it say, but only, “Peep,
peep, pe—weep!” in a melancholy cadence, and
over and over and over again. As often as Ulysses
moved forward, however, the bird showed the
greatest alarm, and did its best to drive him back,
with the anxious flutter of its purple wings. Its
unaccountable behavior made him conclude, at
last, that the bird knew of some danger that
awaited him, and which must needs be very terrible,
beyond all question, since it moved even a
little fowl to feel compassion for a human being.
So he resolved, for the present, to return to the
vessel, and tell his companions what he had seen.</p>

<p>This appeared to satisfy the bird. As soon as
Ulysses turned back, it ran up the trunk of a tree,
and began to pick insects out of the bark with its
long, sharp bill; for it was a kind of woodpecker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
you must know, and had to get its living in the
same manner as other birds of that species. But
every little while, as it pecked at the bark of the
tree, the purple bird bethought itself of some secret
sorrow, and repeated its plaintive note of “Peep,
peep, pe—weep!”</p>

<p>On his way to the shore, Ulysses had the good
luck to kill a large stag by thrusting his spear into
its back. Taking it on his shoulders (for he was a
remarkably strong man), he lugged it along with
him and flung it down before his hungry companions.
I have already hinted to you what gormandisers
some of the comrades of King Ulysses were.
From what is related of them, I reckon that their
favorite diet was pork, and that they had lived
upon it until a good part of their physical substance
was swine’s flesh, and their tempers and dispositions
were very much akin to the hog. A dish of venison,
however, was no unacceptable meal to them, especially
after feeding so long on oysters and clams.
So, beholding the dead stag, they felt of its ribs,
in a knowing way, and lost no time in kindling a
fire of driftwood to cook it. The rest of the day
was spent in feasting; and if these enormous eaters
got up from table at sunset, it was only because
they could not scrape another morsel off the poor
animal’s bones.</p>

<p>The next morning their appetites were as sharp
as ever. They looked at Ulysses, as if they expected
him to clamber up the cliff again, and come
back with another fat deer upon his shoulders. Instead
of setting out, however, he summoned the
whole crew together, and told them it was in vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to hope that he could kill a stag every day for their
dinner, and therefore it was advisable to think of
some other mode of satisfying their hunger.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “when I was on the cliff, yesterday,
I discovered that this island is inhabited. At
a considerable distance from the shore stood a
marble palace, which appeared to be very spacious,
and had a great deal of smoke curling out of one
of its chimneys.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” muttered some of his companions, smacking
their lips. “That smoke must have come from
the kitchen fire. There was a good dinner on the
spit; and no doubt there will be as good a one
to-day.”</p>

<p>“But,” continued the wise Ulysses, “you must
remember, my good friends, our misadventure in
the cavern of one-eyed Polyphemus, the Cyclops!
Instead of his ordinary milk diet, did he not eat up
two of our comrades for his supper, and a couple
more for breakfast, and two at his supper again?
Methinks I see him yet, the hideous monster, scanning
us with that great red eye, in the middle of
his forehead, to single out the fattest. And then,
again, only a few days ago did we not fall into the
hands of the King of the Læstrygons, and those
other horrible giants, his subjects, who devoured a
great many more of us than are now left? To tell
you the truth, if we go to yonder palace, there can
be no question that we shall make our appearance
at the dinner table; but whether seated as guests,
or served up as food, is a point to be seriously
considered.”</p>

<p>“Either way,” murmured some of the hungriest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of the crew, “it will be better than starvation; particularly
if one could be sure of being well fattened
beforehand, and daintily cooked afterwards.”</p>

<p>“That is a matter of taste,” said King Ulysses,
“and, for my own part, neither the most careful
fattening nor the daintiest of cookery would reconcile
me to being dished at last. My proposal is,
therefore, that we divide ourselves into two equal
parties, and ascertain, by drawing lots, which of
the two shall go to the palace, and beg for food and
assistance. If these can be obtained, all is well.
If not, and if the inhabitants prove as inhospitable
as Polyphemus, or the Læstrygons, then there will
but half of us perish, and the remainder may set
sail and escape.”</p>

<p>As nobody objected to this scheme, Ulysses proceeded
to count the whole band, and found that
there were forty-six men, including himself. He
then numbered off twenty-two of them, and put
Eurylochus (who was one of his chief officers, and
second only to himself in sagacity) at their head.
Ulysses took command of the remaining twenty-two
men, in person. Then, taking off his helmet,
he put two shells into it, on one of which was
written “Go,” and on the other, “Stay.” Another
person now held the helmet, while Ulysses and
Eurylochus drew out each a shell; and the word
“Go,” was found written on that which Eurylochus
had drawn. In this manner, it was decided that
Ulysses and his twenty-two men were to remain
at the seaside until the other party should have
found out what sort of treatment they might expect
at the mysterious palace. As there was no help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
for it, Eurylochus immediately set forth at the
head of his twenty-two followers, who went off in
a very melancholy state of mind, leaving their
friends in hardly better spirits than themselves.</p>

<p>No sooner had they clambered up the cliff, than
they discerned the tall marble towers of the palace,
ascending, as white as snow, out of the lovely green
shadow of the trees which surrounded it. A gush
of smoke came from a chimney in the rear of the
edifice. This vapor rose high in the air, and meeting
with a breeze, was wafted seaward and made
to pass over the heads of the hungry mariners.
When people’s appetites are keen, they have a very
quick scent for anything savory in the wind.</p>

<p>“That smoke comes from the kitchen!” cried one
of them, turning up his nose as high as he could,
and snuffing eagerly. “And, as sure as I’m a half-starved
vagabond, I smell roast meat in it.”</p>

<p>“Pig, roast pig!” said another. “Ah, the dainty
little porker! My mouth waters for him.”</p>

<p>“Let us make haste,” cried the others, “or we
shall be too late for the good cheer!”</p>

<p>But scarcely had they made half a dozen steps
from the edge of the cliff, when a bird came
fluttering to meet them. It was the same pretty
little bird, with the purple wings and body, the
yellow legs, the golden collar round its neck, and
the crown-like tuft upon its head, whose behavior
had so much surprised Ulysses. It hovered about
Eurylochus, and almost brushed his face with its
wings.</p>

<p>“Peep, peep, pe—weep!” chirped the bird.</p>

<p>So plaintively intelligent was the sound, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
seemed as if the little creature were going to break
its heart with some mighty secret that it had to tell,
and only this one poor note to tell it with.</p>

<p>“My pretty bird,” said Eurylochus—for he was
a wary person, and let no token of harm escape his
notice—“my pretty bird, who sent you hither? And
what is the message which you bring?”</p>

<p>“Peep, peep, pe—weep!” replied the bird, very
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Then it flew towards the edge of the cliff, and
looked round at them, as if exceedingly anxious
that they should return whence they came. Eurylochus
and a few of the others were inclined to turn
back.</p>

<p>They could not help suspecting that the purple
bird must be aware of something mischievous
that would befall them at the palace, and the
knowledge of which affected its airy spirit with a
human sympathy and sorrow. But the rest of the
voyagers, snuffing up the smoke from the palace
kitchen, ridiculed the idea of returning to the
vessel. One of them (more brutal than his fellows,
and the most notorious gormandiser in the whole
crew) said such a cruel and wicked thing, that I
wonder the mere thought did not turn him into a
wild beast, in shape, as he already was in his nature.</p>

<p>“This troublesome and impertinent little fowl,”
said he, “would make a delicate titbit to begin dinner
with. Just one plump morsel, melting away
between the teeth. If he comes within my reach,
I’ll catch him, and give him to the palace cook to
be roasted on a skewer.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the purple bird flew away, crying, “Peep, peep,
pe—weep,” more dolorously than ever.</p>

<p>“That bird,” remarked Eurylochus, “knows more
than we do about what awaits us at the palace.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” cried his comrades, “and we’ll
soon know as much as he does.”</p>

<p>The party, accordingly, went onward through
the green and pleasant wood. Every little while
they caught new glimpses of the marble palace,
which looked more and more beautiful the nearer
they approached it. They soon entered a broad
pathway, which seemed to be very neatly kept, and
which went winding along, with streaks of sunshine
falling across it, and specks of light quivering
among the deepest shadows that fell from the lofty
trees.</p>

<p>It was bordered, too, with a great many sweet-smelling
flowers, such as the mariners had never
seen before. So rich and beautiful they were, that
if the shrubs grew wild here, and were native in
the soil, then this island was surely the flower garden
of the whole earth; or, if transplanted from
some other clime, it must have been from the happy
islands that lay towards the golden sunset.</p>

<p>“There has been a great deal of pains foolishly
wasted on these flowers,” observed one of the company;
and I tell you what he said, that you may
keep in mind what gormandisers they were. “For
my part, if I were the owner of the palace, I would
bid my gardener cultivate nothing but savory pot
herbs to make a stuffing for roast meat, or to
flavor a stew with.”</p>

<p>“Well said!” cried the others. “But I’ll warrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
you there’s a kitchen garden in the rear of the
palace.”</p>

<p>At one place they came to a crystal spring, and
paused to drink at it for want of liquor which they
liked better. Looking into its bosom, they beheld
their own faces dimly reflected, but so extravagantly
distorted by the gush and motion of the
water, that each one of them appeared to be laughing
at himself and all his companions. So
ridiculous were these images of themselves, indeed,
that they did really laugh aloud, and could hardly
be grave again as soon as they wished. And after
they had drank, they grew still merrier than before.</p>

<p>“It has a twang of the wine cask in it,” said one,
smacking his lips.</p>

<p>“Make haste!” cried his fellows; “we’ll find the
wine cask itself at the palace; and that will be better
than a hundred crystal fountains.”</p>

<p>They then quickened their pace, and capered for
joy at the thought of the savory banquet at which
they hoped to be guests. But Eurylochus told them
that he felt as if he were walking in a dream.</p>

<p>“If I am really awake,” continued he, “then, in
my opinion, we are on the point of meeting with
some stranger adventure than any that befell us in
the cave of Polyphemus, or among the gigantic
man-eating Læstrygons, or in the windy palace
of King Æolus, which stands on a brazen-walled
island. This kind of dreamy feeling always comes
over me before any wonderful occurrence. If you
take my advice, you will turn back.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered his comrades, snuffing the
air, in which the scent from the palace kitchen was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
now very perceptible. “We would not turn back,
though we were certain that the King of the Læstrygons,
as big as a mountain, would sit at the head
of the table, and huge Polyphemus, the one-eyed
Cyclops, at its foot.”</p>

<p>At length they came within full sight of the
palace, which proved to be very large and lofty,
with a great number of airy pinnacles upon its roof.
Though it was now midday, and the sun shone
brightly over the marble front, yet its snowy whiteness
and its fantastic style of architecture made it
look unreal, like the frostwork on a window pane,
or like the shapes of castles which one sees among
the clouds by moonlight. But, just then, a puff
of wind brought down the smoke of the kitchen
chimney among them, and caused each man to smell
the odor of the dish that he liked best; and, after
scenting it, they thought everything else moonshine
and nothing real save this palace, and save the
banquet that was evidently ready to be served up
in it.</p>

<p>So they hastened their steps towards the portal,
but had not got half-way across the wide lawn when
a pack of lions, tigers, and wolves came bounding
to meet them. The terrified mariners started back,
expecting no better fate than to be torn to pieces
and devoured. To their surprise and joy, however,
these wild beasts merely capered around them,
wagging their tails, offering their heads to be
stroked and patted, and behaving just like so many
well-bred house dogs, when they wish to express
their delight at meeting their master or their
master’s friends. The biggest lion licked the feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of Eurylochus; and every other lion, and every wolf
and tiger, singled out one of his two and twenty
followers, whom the beast fondled as if he loved
him better than a beef bone.</p>

<p>But, for all that, Eurylochus imagined that he
saw something fierce and savage in their eyes; nor
would he have been surprised, at any moment, to
feel the big lion’s terrible claws, or to see each of
the tigers make a deadly spring, or each wolf leap
at the throat of the man whom he had fondled.
Their mildness seemed unreal and a mere freak;
but their savage nature was as true as their teeth
and claws.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the men went safely across the
lawn with the wild beasts frisking about them and
doing no manner of harm; although, as they
mounted the steps of the palace, you might possibly
have heard a low growl, particularly from the
wolves; as if they thought it a pity, after all, to let
the strangers pass without so much as tasting what
they were made of.</p>

<p>Eurylochus and his followers now passed under
a lofty portal, and looked through the open doorway
into the interior of the palace. The first thing
that they saw was a spacious hall, and a fountain
in the middle of it gushing up towards the ceiling
out of a marble basin, and falling back into it with
a continual plash. The water of this fountain, as
it spouted upward, was constantly taking new
shapes, not very distinctly but plainly enough for
a nimble fancy to recognize what they were. Now
it was the shape of a man in a long robe, the fleecy
whiteness of which was made out of the fountain’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
spray; now it was a lion, or a tiger, or a wolf, or
an ass, or, as often as anything else, a hog, wallowing
in the marble basin as if it were his sty. It
was either magic or some very curious machinery
that caused the gushing waterspout to assume all
these forms. But, before the strangers had time
to look closely at this wonderful sight, their attention
was drawn off by a very sweet and agreeable
sound. A woman’s voice was singing melodiously
in another room of the palace, and with her voice
was mingled the noise of a loom, at which she was
probably seated, weaving a rich texture of cloth,
and intertwining the high and low sweetness of her
voice into a rich tissue of harmony.</p>

<p>By and by, the song came to an end; and then,
all at once, there were several feminine voices talking
airily and cheerfully, with now and then a
merry burst of laughter such as you may always
hear when three or four young women sit at work
together.</p>

<p>“Just listen to the pleasant voices of those
maidens, and that buzz of the loom, as the shuttle
passes to and fro,” said another comrade. “What
a domestic, household, home-like sound it is! Ah
before that weary siege of Troy, I used to hear the
buzzing loom and the women’s voices under my
own roof. Shall I never hear them again? nor taste
those nice little savory dishes which my dearest
wife knew how to serve up?”</p>

<p>“Tush! we shall fare better here,” said another.
“But how innocently those women are babbling
together, without guessing that we overhear them!
And mark that richest voice of all, so pleasant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
familiar, but which yet seems to have the authority
of a mistress among them. Let us show ourselves
at once. What harm can the lady of the palace
and her maidens do to mariners and warriors
like us?”</p>

<p>“Remember,” said Eurylochus, “that it was a
young maiden who beguiled three of our friends
into the palace of the King of the Læstrygons, who
ate up one of them in the twinkling of an eye.”</p>

<p>No warning or persuasion, however, had any
effect on his companions. They went up to a pair
of folding doors at the farther end of the hall, and
throwing them wide open, passed into the next
room. Eurylochus, meanwhile, had stepped behind
a pillar. In a short moment while the folding
doors opened and closed again, he caught a glimpse
of a very beautiful woman rising from the loom,
and coming to meet the poor weather-beaten
wanderers, with a hospitable smile, and her hand
stretched out in welcome. There were four other
young women, who joined their hands and danced
merrily forward, making gestures of obeisance to
the strangers. They were only less beautiful than
the lady who seemed to be their mistress. Yet
Eurylochus fancied that one of them had sea-green
hair, and that the close-fitting bodice of a second
looked like the hark of a tree, and that both the
others had something odd in their aspect, although
he could not quite determine what it was, in the
little while that he had to examine them.</p>

<p>The folding doors swung quickly back, and left
him standing behind the pillar, in the solitude of
the outer hall. There Eurylochus waited until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
was quite weary, and listened eagerly to every
sound, but without hearing anything that could
help him to guess what had become of his friends.
Footsteps, it is true, seemed to be passing and repassing
in other parts of the palace. Then there
was a clatter of silver dishes, or golden ones, which
made him imagine a rich feast in a splendid banqueting
hall. But by and by he heard a tremendous
grunting and squealing, and then a sudden scampering
like that of small hard hoofs over a marble
floor, while the voices of the mistress and her four
hand-maidens were screaming all together, in tones
of anger and derision. Eurylochus could not conceive
what had happened, unless a drove of swine
had broken into the palace, attracted by the smell
of the feast. Chancing to cast his eyes at the fountain,
he saw that it did not shift its shape as
formerly, nor looked either like a long-robed man,
or a lion, a tiger, a wolf, or an ass. It looked like
nothing but a hog, which lay wallowing in the
marble basin, and filled it from brim to brim.</p>

<p>But we must leave the prudent Eurylochus waiting
in the outer hall, and follow his friends into
the inner secrecy of the palace. As soon as the
beautiful woman saw them, she arose from the loom,
as I have told you, and came forward, smiling,
and stretching out her hand. She took the hand
of the foremost among them, and bade him and
the whole party welcome.</p>

<p>“You have been long expected, my good
friends,” said she. “I and my maidens are well
acquainted with you, although you do not appear
to recognize us. Look at this piece of tapestry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
judge if your faces must not have been familiar
to us.”</p>

<p>So the voyagers examined the web of cloth which
the beautiful woman had been weaving in her loom;
and, to their vast astonishment, they saw their own
figures perfectly represented in different colored
threads. It was a life-like picture of their recent
adventures, showing them in the cave of Polyphemus,
and how they had put out his one great moon-eye;
while in another part of the tapestry they
were untying the leathern bags, puffed out with
contrary winds; and farther on, they beheld themselves
scampering away from the gigantic King
of the Læstrygons, who had caught one of them
by the leg. Lastly, there they were, sitting on the
desolate shore of this very island, hungry and
downcast, and looking ruefully at the bare bones
of the stag which they devoured yesterday. This
was as far as the work had yet proceeded; but
when the beautiful woman should again sit down
at her loom, she would probably make a picture of
what had since happened to the strangers, and of
what was now going to happen.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said, “that I know all about your
troubles; and you cannot doubt that I desire to
make you happy for as long a time as you may
remain with me. For this purpose, my honored
guests, I have ordered a banquet to be prepared.
Fish, fowl, and flesh, roasted and in luscious stews,
and seasoned, I trust, to all your tastes, are ready
to be served up. If your appetites tell you it is
dinner-time, then come with me to the festal
saloon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>At this kind invitation, the hungry mariners
were quite overjoyed; and one of them, taking
upon himself to be spokesman, assured their hospitable
hostess that any hour of the day was dinner-time
with them, whenever they could get flesh to
put in the pot, and fire to boil it with. So the
beautiful woman led the way; and the four maidens
(one of them had sea-green hair, another a bodice
of oak-bark, a third sprinkled a shower of water
drops from her fingers’ ends, and the fourth had
some other oddity, which I have forgotten), all
these followed behind, and hurried the guests
along, until they entered a magnificent saloon. It
was built in a perfect oval, and lighted from a
crystal dome above. Around the walls were ranged
two and twenty thrones, overhung by canopies of
crimson and gold, and provided with the softest
of cushions which were tasselled and fringed with
gold cord. Each of the strangers was invited to
sit down; and there they were, two and twenty
storm-beaten mariners in worn and tattered garb,
sitting on two and twenty cushioned and canopied
thrones, so rich and gorgeous that the proudest
monarch had nothing more splendid in his stateliest
hall.</p>

<p>Then you might have seen the guests nodding,
winking with one eye, and leaning from one throne
to another, to communicate their satisfaction in
hoarse whispers.</p>

<p>“Our good hostess has made kings of us all,”
said one. “Ha! do you smell the feast? I’ll engage
it will be fit to set before two and twenty kings.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” said another, “it will be mainly good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
substantial joints, sirloins, spareribs, and hinder
quarters, without too many kickshaws. If I
thought the good lady would not take it amiss, I
should call for a fat slice of dried bacon to begin
with.”</p>

<p>Ah, the gluttons and gormandisers! You see
how it was with them. In the loftiest seats of
dignity, on royal thrones, they could think of nothing
but their greedy appetite, which was the portion
of their nature that they shared with wolves and
swine; so that they resembled those vilest of animals
far more than they did kings—if, indeed, kings
were what they ought to be.</p>

<p>But the beautiful woman now clapped her hands;
and immediately there entered a train of two and
twenty serving men, bringing dishes of the richest
food, all hot from the kitchen fire, and sending up
such a steam that it hung like a cloud below the
crystal dome of the saloon. An equal number of
attendants brought great flagons of wine, of various
kinds, some of which sparkled as it was poured out,
and went bubbling down the throat; while, of other
sorts, the purple liquor was so clear that you could
see the wrought figures at the bottom of the goblet.
While the servants supplied the two and twenty
guests with food and drink, the hostess and her
four maidens went from one throne to another,
exhorting them to eat their fill, and to quaff wine
abundantly, and thus to recompense themselves, at
this one banquet, for the many days when they had
gone without a dinner. But, whenever the mariners
were not looking at them (which was pretty often,
as they looked chiefly into the basins and platters),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the beautiful woman and her damsels turned aside,
and laughed. Even the servants, as they knelt
down to present the dishes, might be seen to grin
and sneer, while the guests were helping themselves
to the offered dainties.</p>

<p>And, once in a while, the strangers seemed to
taste something that they did not like.</p>

<p>“Here is an odd kind of a spice in this dish,”
said one. “I can’t say it quite suits my palate.
Down it goes, however.”</p>

<p>“Send a good draught of wine down your throat,”
said his comrade on the next throne. “That is the
stuff to make this sort of cookery relish well.
Though I must needs say, the wine has a queer
taste, too. But the more I drink of it, the better I
like the flavor.”</p>

<p>Whatever little fault they might find with the
dishes, they sat at dinner a prodigiously long while;
and it would really have made you ashamed to see
how they swilled down the liquor and gobbled up
the food.</p>

<p>They sat on golden thrones, to be sure, but
they behaved like pigs in a sty; and, if they had
had their wits about them, they might have guessed
that this was the opinion of their beautiful hostess
and her maidens. It brings a blush into my face
to reckon up, in my own mind, what mountains of
meat and pudding, and what gallons of wine these
two and twenty guzzlers and gormandisers ate
and drank. They forgot all about their homes
and their wives and children, and all about Ulysses,
and everything else, except this banquet at which
they wanted to keep feasting for ever. But at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
length they began to give over from mere incapacity
to hold any more.</p>

<p>“That last bit of fat is too much for me,” said
one.</p>

<p>“And I have not room for another morsel,” said
his next neighbor, heaving a sigh. “What a pity!
My appetite is as sharp as ever.”</p>

<p>In short, they all left off eating and leaned back
on their thrones, with such a stupid and helpless
aspect, as made them ridiculous to behold. When
their hostess saw this, she laughed aloud; so did
her four damsels; so did the two and twenty serving
men that bore the dishes, and their two and
twenty fellows that poured out the wine. And the
louder they all laughed, the more stupid and helpless
did the two and twenty gormandisers look.
Then the beautiful woman took her stand in the
middle of the saloon, and stretching out a slender
rod (it had been all the while in her hand, although
they never noticed it till this moment), she turned
it from one guest to another, until each had felt it
pointed at himself. Beautiful as her face was, and
though there was a smile on it, it looked just as
wicked and mischievous as the ugliest serpent that
ever was seen; and fat-witted as the voyagers had
made themselves, they began to suspect that they
had fallen into the power of an evil-minded enchantress.</p>

<p>“Wretches,” cried she, “you have abused a lady’s
hospitality; and in this princely saloon your behavior
has been suited to a hog-pen. You are
already swine in everything but the human form,
which you disgrace, and which I myself should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
ashamed to keep a moment longer were you to share
it with me. But it will require only the slightest
exercise of magic to make the exterior conform to
the hoggish disposition. Assume your proper
shapes, gormandisers, and begone to the sty!”</p>

<p>Uttering these last words, she waved her wand;
and stamping her foot imperiously, each of the
guests was struck aghast at beholding, instead of
his comrades in human shape, one and twenty hogs
sitting on the same number of golden thrones.
Each man (as he still supposed himself to be) essayed
to give a cry of surprise but found that he
could merely grunt, and that, in a word, he was
just such another beast as his companions. It
looked so intolerably absurd to see hogs on
cushioned thrones, that they made haste to wallow
down upon all fours like other swine. They tried
to groan and beg for mercy, but forthwith emitted
the most awful grunting and squealing that ever
came out of swinish throats. They would have
wrung their hands in despair, but, attempting to
do so, grew all the more desperate for seeing themselves
squatted on their hams and pawing the air
with their fore-trotters. Dear me! what pendulous
ears they had! what little red eyes, half buried in
fat! and what long snouts, instead of Grecian
noses!</p>

<p>But brutes as they certainly were, they yet had
enough of human nature in them to be shocked at
their own hideousness; and, still intending to groan,
they uttered a viler grunt and squeal than before.
So harsh and ear-piercing it was, that you would
have fancied a butcher was sticking his knife into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
each of their throats, or, at the very least, that
somebody was pulling every hog by his funny little
twist of a tail.</p>

<p>“Begone to your sty!” cried the enchantress,
giving them some smart strokes with her wand; and
then she turned to the serving men—“Drive out
these swine, and throw down some acorns for them
to eat.”</p>

<p>The door of the saloon being flung open, the
drove of hogs ran in all directions save the right
one, in accordance with their hoggish perversity,
but were finally driven into the back yard of the
palace. It was a sight to bring tears into one’s
eyes (and I hope none of you will be cruel enough
to laugh at it), to see the poor creatures go snuffing
along, picking up here a cabbage-leaf, and there a
turnip-top, and rooting their noses in the earth for
whatever they could find. In their sty, moreover,
they behaved more piggishly than the pigs that
had been born so; for they bit and snorted at one
another, put their feet in the trough, and gobbled
up their victuals in a ridiculous hurry; and, when
there was nothing more to be had, they made a
great pile of themselves among some unclean
straw, and fell fast asleep. If they had any human
reason left, it was just enough to keep them wondering
when they should be slaughtered, and what
quality of bacon they should make.</p>

<p>Meantime, as I told you before, Eurylochus had
waited, and waited, and waited in the entrance hall
of the palace, without being able to comprehend
what had befallen his friends. At last, when the
swinish uproar resounded through the palace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
when he saw the image of a hog in the marble basin,
he thought it best to hasten back to the vessel, and
inform the wise Ulysses of these marvellous occurrences.</p>

<p>So he ran as fast as he could down the steps,
and never stopped to draw breath till he reached
the shore.</p>

<p>“Why do you come alone?” asked King Ulysses
as soon as he saw him. “Where are your two and
twenty comrades?”</p>

<p>At these questions, Eurylochus burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried he, “I greatly fear that we shall
never see one of their faces again.”</p>

<p>Then he told Ulysses all that had happened, as
far as he knew it, and added that he suspected the
beautiful woman to be a vile enchantress, and the
marble palace, magnificent as it looked, to be only
a dismal cavern in reality. As for his companions,
he could not imagine what had become of them,
unless they had been given to the swine to be devoured
alive. At this intelligence, all the voyagers
were greatly affrighted. But Ulysses lost no time
in girding on his sword, and hanging his bow and
quiver over his shoulders, and taking a spear in his
right hand. When his followers saw their wise
leader making these preparations, they inquired
whither he was going, and earnestly besought him
not to leave them.</p>

<p>“You are our king,” cried they; “and what is
more, you are the wisest man in the whole world,
and nothing but your wisdom and courage can get
us out of this danger. If you desert us, and go to
the enchanted palace, you will suffer the same fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
as our poor companions, and not a soul of us will
ever see our dear Ithaca again.”</p>

<p>“As I am your king,” answered Ulysses, “and
wiser than any of you, it is therefore the more my
duty to see what has befallen our comrades, and
whether anything can yet be done to rescue them.
Wait for me here until to-morrow. If I do not
then return, you must hoist sail, and endeavor to
find your way to our native land. For my part, I
am answerable for the fate of these poor mariners,
who have stood by my side in battle, and been so
often drenched to the skin, along with me, by the
same tempestuous surges. I will either bring them
back with me, or perish.”</p>

<p>Had his followers dared, they would have detained
him by force. But King Ulysses frowned
sternly on them, and shook his spear, and bade
them stop him at their peril.</p>

<p>Seeing him so determined, they let him go, and
sat down on the sand, as disconsolate a set of
people as could be, waiting and praying for his
return.</p>

<p>It happened to Ulysses, just as before, that,
when he had gone a few steps from the edge of the
cliff, the purple bird came fluttering towards him,
crying, “Peep, peep, pe—weep!” and using all the
art it could to persuade him to go no farther.</p>

<p>“What mean you, little bird?” cried Ulysses.
“You are arrayed like a king in purple and gold,
and wear a golden crown upon your head. Is it
because I, too, am a king, that you desire so earnestly
to speak with me? If you can talk in human
language, say what you would have me do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>“Peep!” answered the purple bird, very dolorously.
“Peep, peep, pe—we—ep!”</p>

<p>Certainly there lay some heavy anguish at the
little bird’s heart; and it was a sorrowful predicament
that he could not, at least, have the consolation
of telling what it was. But Ulysses had no
time to waste in trying to get at the mystery. He
therefore quickened his pace, and had gone a good
way along the pleasant wood path, when there met
him a young man of very brisk and intelligent
aspect, and clad in a rather singular garb. He
wore a short cloak, and a sort of cap that seemed
to be furnished with a pair of wings; and from the
lightness of his step, you would have supposed
that there might likewise be wings on his feet. To
enable him to walk still better (for he was always
on one journey or another), he carried a winged
staff, around which two serpents were wriggling
and twisting.</p>

<p>In short, I have said enough to make you
guess that it was Quicksilver; and Ulysses (who
knew him of old, and had learned a great deal
of his wisdom from him) recognized him in a
moment.</p>

<p>“Whither are you going in such a hurry, wise
Ulysses?” asked Quicksilver. “Do you not know
that this island is enchanted? The wicked enchantress
(whose name is Circe, the sister of King
Æetes) dwells in the marble palace which you see
yonder among the trees. By her magic arts, she
changes every human being into the brute beast or
fowl whom he happens most to resemble.”</p>

<p>“That little bird, which met me at the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the cliff,” exclaimed Ulysses, “was he a human
being once?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Quicksilver. “He was once a
king, named Picus, and a pretty good sort of a
king, too, only rather too proud of his purple robe,
and his crown, and the golden chain about his neck;
so he was forced to take the shape of a gaudy
feathered bird. The lions, and wolves, and tigers,
who will come running to meet you, in front of the
palace, were formerly fierce and cruel men, resembling
in their disposition the wild beasts whose
forms they now rightfully wear.”</p>

<p>“And my poor companions,” said Ulysses.
“Have they undergone a similar change, through
the arts of this wicked Circe?”</p>

<p>“You well know what gormandisers they were,”
replied Quicksilver; and, rogue that he was, he
could not help laughing at the joke. “So you will
not be surprised to hear that they have all taken
the shapes of swine! If Circe had never done anything
worse, I really should not think her so very
much to blame.”</p>

<p>“But can I do nothing to help them?” inquired
Ulysses.</p>

<p>“It will require all your wisdom,” said Quicksilver,
“and a little of my own into the bargain, to
keep your royal and sagacious self from being
transformed into a fox. But do as I bid you; and
the matter may end better than it has begun.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Quicksilver seemed to be
in search of something; he went stooping along the
ground, and soon laid his hand on a little plant with
a snow-white flower, which he plucked and smelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of. Ulysses had been looking at that very spot
only just before; and it appeared to him that the
plant had burst into full flower the instant when
Quicksilver touched it with his fingers.</p>

<p>“Take this flower, King Ulysses,” said he.
“Guard it as you do your eyesight; for I can assure
you it is exceedingly rare and precious, and you
might seek the whole earth over without ever finding
another like it. Keep it in your hand, and smell
of it frequently after you enter the palace, and
while you are talking with the enchantress. Especially
when she offers you food or a draught of
wine out of her goblet, be careful to fill your nostrils
with the flower’s fragrance. Follow these
directions, and you may defy her magic arts to
change you into a fox.”</p>

<p>Quicksilver then gave him some further advice
how to behave, and bidding him be bold and prudent,
again assured him that, powerful as Circe was,
he would have a fair prospect of coming safely out
of her enchanted palace. After listening attentively,
Ulysses thanked his good friend, and resumed
his way. But he had taken only a few steps,
when, recollecting some other questions which he
wished to ask, he turned round again, and beheld
nobody on the spot where Quicksilver had stood;
for that winged cap of his, and those winged shoes,
with the help of the winged staff, had carried him
quickly out of sight.</p>

<p>When Ulysses reached the lawn, in front of the
palace, the lions and other savage animals came
bounding to meet him, and would have fawned
upon him and licked his feet. But the wise king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
struck at them with his long spear, and sternly
bade them begone out of his path; for he knew that
they had once been bloodthirsty men, and would
now tear him limb from limb, instead of fawning
upon him, could they do the mischief that was in
their hearts. The wild beasts yelped and glared
at him, and stood at a distance, while he ascended
the palace steps.</p>

<p>On entering the hall, Ulysses saw the magic
fountain in the center of it. The up-gushing water
had now again taken the shape of a man in a long,
white fleecy robe, who appeared to be making gestures
of welcome. The king likewise heard the
noise of the shuttle in the loom, and the sweet
melody of the beautiful woman’s song, and then the
pleasant voices of herself and the four maidens
talking together, with peals of merry laughter
intermixed. But Ulysses did not waste much time
in listening to the laughter or the song. He leaned
his spear against one of the pillars of the hall, and
then, after loosening his sword in the scabbard,
stepped boldly forward, and threw the folding
doors wide open. The moment she beheld his
stately figure standing in the doorway, the beautiful
woman rose from the loom, and ran to meet
him with a glad smile throwing its sunshine over
her face, and both her hands extended.</p>

<p>“Welcome, brave stranger!” cried she. “We
were expecting you.”</p>

<p>And the nymph with the sea-green hair made a
curtsey down to the ground, and likewise bade him
welcome; so did her sister with the bodice of oaken
bark, and she that sprinkled dewdrops from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
fingers’ ends, and the fourth one with some oddity
which I cannot remember. And Circe, as the beautiful
enchantress was called (who had deluded so
many persons that she did not doubt of being able
to delude Ulysses, not imagining how wise he was),
again addressed him:—</p>

<p>“Your companions,” said she, “have already
been received into my palace, and have enjoyed
the hospitable treatment to which the propriety of
their behavior so well entitles them. If such be
your pleasure, you shall first take some refreshment,
and then join them in the elegant apartments
which they now occupy. See, I and my maidens
have been weaving their figures into this piece of
tapestry.”</p>

<p>She pointed to the web of beautifully woven cloth
in the loom. Circe and the four nymphs must have
been very diligently at work since the arrival of
the mariners; for a great many yards of tapestry
had now been wrought, in addition to what I have
before described. In this new part, Ulysses saw
his two and twenty friends represented as sitting
on cushioned and canopied thrones, greedily devouring
dainties, and quaffing deep draughts of
wine. The work had not yet gone any further. O,
no indeed. The enchantress was far too cunning
to let Ulysses see the mischief which her magic arts
had since brought upon the gormandisers.</p>

<p>“As for yourself, valiant sir,” said Circe, “judging
by the dignity of your aspect, I take you to be
nothing less than a king. Deign to follow me, and
you shall be treated as befits your rank.”</p>

<p>So Ulysses followed her into the oval saloon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
where his two and twenty comrades had devoured
the banquet, which ended so disastrously for themselves,
but all this while, he had held the snow-white
flower in his hand, and had constantly smelt
of it while Circe was speaking; and as he crossed
the threshold of the saloon, he took good care to
inhale several long and deep snuffs of its fragrance.
Instead of two and twenty thrones which had before
been ranged around the wall, there was now
only a single throne, in the center of the apartment.
But this was surely the most magnificent
seat that ever a king or an emperor reposed himself
upon, all made of chased gold, studded with
precious stones, with a cushion that looked like a
soft heap of living roses, and overhung by a canopy
of sunlight which Circe knew how to weave into
drapery. The enchantress took Ulysses by the
hand, and made him sit down upon this dazzling
throne.</p>

<p>Then clapping her hands, she summoned the
chief butler.</p>

<p>“Bring hither,” said she, “the goblet that is set
apart for kings to drink out of. And fill it with
the same delicious wine which my royal brother,
King Æetes, praised so highly, when he last visited
me with my fair daughter Medea. That good and
amiable child! Were she now here, it would delight
her to see me offering this wine to my honored
guest.”</p>

<p>But Ulysses, while the butler was gone for the
wine, held the snow-white flower to his nose.</p>

<p>“Is it a wholesome wine?” he asked.</p>

<p>At this the four maidens tittered; whereupon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
enchantress looked round at them with an aspect
of severity.</p>

<p>“It is the wholesomest juice that ever was
squeezed out of the grape,” said she; “for, instead
of disguising a man, as other liquor is apt to do, it
brings him to his true self, and shows him as he
ought to be.”</p>

<p>The chief butler liked nothing better than to see
people turned into swine, or making any kind of a
beast of themselves; so he made haste to bring the
royal goblet, filled with a liquid as bright as gold,
and which kept sparkling upward, and throwing a
sunny spray over the brim. But, delightfully as
the wine looked, it was mingled with the most
potent enchantments that Circe knew how to concoct.
For every drop of the pure grape juice there
were two drops of the pure mischief; and the danger
of the thing was, that the mischief made it taste
all the better. The mere smell of the bubbles, which
effervesced at the brim, was enough to turn a man’s
beard into pig’s bristles, or make a lion’s claws grow
out of his fingers or a fox’s brush behind him.</p>

<p>“Drink, my noble guest,” said Circe, smiling as
she presented him with the goblet. “You will find
in this draught a solace for all your troubles.”</p>

<p>King Ulysses took the goblet with his right
hand, while with his left he held the snow-white
flower to his nostrils, and drew in so long a breath
that his lungs were quite filled with its pure and
simple fragrance. Then, drinking off all the wine,
he looked the enchantress calmly in the face.</p>

<p>“Wretch,” cried Circe, giving him a smart stroke
with her wand, “how dare you keep your human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
shape a moment longer? Take the form of the
brute whom you most resemble. If a hog, go join
your fellow-swine in the sty; if a lion, a wolf, a
tiger, go howl with the wild beasts on the lawn; if
a fox, go exercise your craft in stealing poultry.
Thou hast quaffed off my wine, and canst be man
no longer.”</p>

<p>But, such was the virtue of the snow-white
flower, instead of wallowing down from his throne
in swinish shape, or taking any other brutal form,
Ulysses looked even more manly and king-like
than before. He gave the magic goblet a toss, and
sent it clashing over the marble floor, to the farther
end of the saloon. Then, drawing his sword, he
seized the enchantress by her beautiful ringlets, and
made a gesture as if he meant to strike off her head
at one blow.</p>

<p>“Wicked Circe,” cried he, in a terrible voice,
“this sword shall put an end to thy enchantments.
Thou shalt die, vile witch, and do no more mischief
in the world, by tempting human beings into the
vices which make beasts of them.”</p>

<p>The tone and countenance of Ulysses were so
awful, and his sword gleamed so brightly, and
seemed to have so intolerably keen an edge, that
Circe was almost killed by the mere fright, without
waiting for a blow. The chief butler scrambled out
of the saloon, picking up the golden goblet as he
went; and the enchantress and the four maidens
fell on their knees, wringing their hands, and
screaming for mercy.</p>

<p>“Spare me!” cried Circe. “Spare me, royal and
wise Ulysses. For now I know that thou art he of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
whom Quicksilver forewarned me, the most prudent
of mortals, against whom no enchantments
can prevail. Thou only couldst have conquered
Circe. Spare me, wisest of men. I will show thee
true hospitality, and even give myself to be thy
slave, and this magnificent palace to be henceforth
thy home.”</p>

<p>The four nymphs, meanwhile, were making a
most piteous ado; and especially the ocean nymph
with the sea-green hair, wept a great deal of salt-water,
and the fountain nymph, besides scattering
dewdrops from her fingers’ ends, nearly melted
away into tears. But Ulysses would not be pacified
until Circe had taken a solemn oath to change back
his companions, and as many others as he should
direct, from their present forms of beast or bird
into their former shapes of men.</p>

<p>“On these conditions,” said he, “I consent to
spare your life. Otherwise you must die upon the
spot.”</p>

<p>With a drawn sword hanging over her, the enchantress
would readily have consented to do as
much good as she had hitherto done mischief, however
little she might like such employment. She
therefore led Ulysses out of the back entrance of
the palace, and showed him the swine in their sty.
There were about fifty of these unclean beasts in
the whole herd; and though the greater part were
hogs by birth and education, there was wonderfully
little difference to be seen betwixt them and their
new brethren, who had so recently worn the human
shape. To speak critically, indeed, the latter rather
carried the thing to excess, and seemed to make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
a point to wallow in the miriest part of the sty, and
otherwise to outdo the original swine in their own
natural vocation. When men once turn to brutes,
the trifle of man’s wit that remains in them adds
tenfold to their brutality.</p>

<p>The comrades of Ulysses, however, had not quite
lost the remembrance of having formerly stood
erect. When he approached the sty, two and
twenty enormous swine separated themselves from
the herd, and scampered towards him, with such a
chorus of horrible squealing as made him clap both
hands to his ears. And yet they did not seem
to know what they wanted, nor whether they were
merely hungry, or miserable from some other cause.
It was curious, in the midst of their distress, to
observe them thrusting their noses into the mire, in
quest of something to eat. The nymph with the
bodice of oaken bark (she was the hamadryad of
an oak) threw a handful of acorns among them;
and the two and twenty hogs scrambled and fought
for the prize, as if they had tasted not so much as
a noggin of sour milk for a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>“These must certainly be my comrades,” said
Ulysses. “I recognize their dispositions. They
are hardly worth the trouble of changing them into
the human form again. Nevertheless, we will have
it done, lest their bad example should corrupt the
other hogs. Let them take their original shapes,
therefore, Dame Circe, if your skill is equal to the
task. It will require greater magic, I trow, than it
did to make swine of them.”</p>

<p>So Circe waved her wand again, and repeated a
few magic words, at the sound of which the two and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
twenty hogs pricked up their pendulous ears. It
was a wonder to behold how their snouts grew
shorter and shorter, and their mouths (which they
seemed to be sorry for, because they could not
gobble so expeditiously) smaller and smaller, and
how one and another began to stand upon his hind
legs, and scratch his nose with his fore trotters.
At first the spectators hardly knew whether to call
them hogs or men, but by and by came to the conclusion
that they rather resembled the latter. Finally,
there stood the twenty-two comrades of
Ulysses, looking pretty much the same as when
they left the vessel.</p>

<p>You must not imagine, however, that the swinish
quality had entirely gone out of them. When once
it fastens itself into a person’s character, it is very
difficult getting rid of it. This was proved by the
hamadryad, who, being exceedingly fond of mischief,
threw another handful of acorns before the
twenty-two newly restored people; whereupon
down they wallowed, in a moment, and gobbled
them up in a very shameful way.</p>

<p>Then, recollecting themselves, they scrambled
to their feet, and looked more than commonly
foolish.</p>

<p>“Thanks, noble Ulysses!” they cried. “From
brute beasts you have restored us to the condition
of men again.”</p>

<p>“Do not put yourselves to the trouble of thanking
me,” said the wise king. “I fear I have done
but little for you.”</p>

<p>To say the truth, there was a suspicious kind of a
grunt in their voices, and, for a long time afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
they spoke gruffly, and were apt to set up a
squeal.</p>

<p>“It must depend upon your own future behavior,”
added Ulysses, “whether you do not find
your way back to the sty.”</p>

<p>At this moment, the note of a bird sounded from
the branch of a neighboring tree.</p>

<p>“Peep, peep, pe—wee—ep!”</p>

<p>It was the purple bird, who, all this while, had
been sitting over their heads, watching what was
going forward, and hoping that Ulysses would remember
how he had done his utmost to keep him
and his followers out of harm’s way. Ulysses ordered
Circe instantly to make a king of this good
little fowl and leave him exactly as she found
him. Hardly were the words spoken, and
before the bird had time to utter another
“pe—weep,” King Picus leaped down from the
bough of the tree, as majestic a sovereign as any in
the world, dressed in a long purple robe and gorgeous
yellow stockings, with a splendidly wrought
collar about his neck, and a golden crown upon his
head. He and King Ulysses exchanged with one
another the courtesies which belong to their elevated
rank. But from that time forth, King Picus
was no longer proud of his crown and his trappings
of royalty, nor of the fact of his being a king; he
felt himself merely the upper servant of his people,
and that it must be his life-long labor to make
them better and happier.</p>

<p>As for the lions, tigers, and wolves (though Circe
would have restored them to their former shapes at
his slightest word), Ulysses thought it advisable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
that they should remain as they now were, and thus
give warning of their cruel dispositions, instead of
going about under the guise of men, and pretending
to human sympathies, while their hearts had the
bloodthirstiness of wild beasts. So he let them
howl as much as they liked, but never troubled his
head about them. And, when everything was settled
according to his pleasure, he sent to summon
the remainder of his comrades, whom he had left at
the seashore. These being arrived, with the prudent
Eurylochus at their head, they all made themselves
comfortable in Circe’s enchanted palace,
until quite rested and refreshed from the toils and
hardships of their voyage.</p>

<h3 id="ULYSSES_AND_THE_SIRENS">ULYSSES AND THE SIRENS</h3>

<p class="author">By Sir George W. Cox</p>

<p class="dropcap">When Ulysses and his men had left the island
of the lady Circe, a fresh breeze carried
them merrily for several days over the sea. But
after that the wind sank down, and there was a
calm. The sails flapped against the mast, and they
had to take them down and to row the ship on with
their long oars. The sun was shining hot and fierce,
and the men were very tired. There was not even
a ripple upon the sea, and not a breath of air to cool
their burning faces.</p>

<p>Ulysses remembered how the lady Circe had told
him that he would have to pass near the Sirens’ island
where the sea was always calm, and how she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
said that he must take care not to listen to the
Sirens’ song, if he did not wish his ship to be dashed
to pieces on the rocks. For, all day long, the Sirens
lay on the seashore, or swam about in the calm
water, singing so sweetly that no one who heard
them could ever pass on without going to them:
and whoever went to them was killed upon the
rocks, for the Sirens were very beautiful and cruel,
and they sang their soft enticing song, to draw
the sailors into the shallow water, that their ships
might be broken on the terrible reefs which lay
hidden beneath the calm sea. When Circe told
Ulysses of the Sirens’ rocks, she said that he must
fill his sailors’ ears with wax, that they might not
hear the song and be drawn in upon those terrible
reefs. So, as the sun shone down fiercely on their
heads, Ulysses thought they must be coming near to
the island of the Sirens; and he took a large lump
of wax and pressed it in his fingers till the hot sun
made it soft and sticky. Then he called the men
and told them he must fill their ears with wax, so
they would not hear the song of the beautiful and
cruel Sirens. But Ulysses was a very strange man,
and liked to hear and see everything; so he said
that he must hear the song himself, and that they
must tie him to the mast for fear he should leap
into the sea to swim to the Sirens’ land.</p>

<p>Then he filled the sailors’ ears with wax so that
they could hear nothing; and they took a large rope
and put it two or three times round the arms and
waist of Ulysses; and then they sat down again on
their benches, and began to row the ship on as
quickly as they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently through the breathless air, and over
the still and sleeping sea, there came a sound so
sweet and soothing that Ulysses thought that he
could no longer be living on the earth. Softer and
sweeter it swelled upon the ear, and it seemed to
speak to him of rest and peace, although he could
hear no words; and he felt as if he could give up
everything if only he might hear those sweet sounds
for ever. So he made signs to the sailors to row on
quicker; but presently the song rose in the sultry
air, more sweet and gentle and enticing; and it
seemed to say:</p>

<p>“O tired and weary sailors, why do you toil so
hard to row your ship under this fierce hot sun?
Come to us, and sit among these cool rocks: come
and rest—come and rest.”</p>

<p>But he did not yet hear the words, for they were
still too far from the Sirens’ rocks. Still, nearer
and nearer the sailors rowed; and now he heard the
words of their song, and he knew that they were
speaking to himself, for they said:</p>

<p>“O, Ulysses, man of many toils and long wanderings,
great glory of the Greeks, come to us and
listen to our song. Every one who passes over
the sea near our island stays to hear it, and forgets
all his labor and all his trouble, and then goes
away peaceful and happy. Come and rest, Ulysses,
come and rest. We know all the great deeds
you have done at Troy, and how you have been
tossed by many storms, and suffered many sorrows
sailing on the wide sea. But here the sea is always
calm, and the sun cannot scorch you in the cool and
pleasant caves where you shall hear us sing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Ulysses cried out to the sailors, “Let me
go, let me go, they are calling me; do you not
hear?” And he struggled with all his might to
break the cords that bound him; but when they saw
him trying to get free, they went and tied stronger
cords round his arms and waist, and rowed on
quicker than ever. And still Ulysses prayed them
to set him free, that he might leap into the sea and
swim to the Sirens’ caves. “I cannot stay,” he said;
“they are calling me by my name; their song rises
sweeter and clearer than ever; let us go, let us go.”
And again he heard them singing.</p>

<p>“O man of many toils, we are waiting for you
and will sing you to sleep, and charm all your cares
away for ever.”</p>

<p>But quicker and quicker the sailors rowed on,
till at last they had passed the island. And the
Sirens saw that Ulysses was going away; but yet
again they sang.</p>

<p>“Come back, Ulysses, come back and rest in our
cool green caves, O man of many griefs and wanderings.”
But the sound of their sweet song was
now faint before it reached the ship of Ulysses,
and he could only just hear them say:</p>

<p>“Will you leave us, will you leave us? Ah, Ulysses,
you do not know what you are losing. Come
to our cool green caves; we are waiting—we are
waiting.”</p>

<p>But the power of the Sirens’ song grew weaker
as the ship went further away; and Ulysses began
to think how foolish and silly he had been. He
could not hear any more the words of the song, as
they called him by his name; but still he half wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
to go back to the Sirens’ land, while yet he heard
the sound of their singing, as it came faint and
weak through the hot and breathless air. Soon it
was all ended. The sky was still; the waves were
all asleep; the clouds looked down drowsily on the
water; and Ulysses thought that he could die, he
was so tired and spent with struggling.</p>

<p>So when the sailors saw that Ulysses did not
struggle any more, they went and set him free, and
took the wax out of their ears. And Ulysses said,
“O friends, it is better not to hear the Sirens’ song;
for if but two or three of us had heard it, we should
have gone to them, and our ship would have been
sunk in their green caves.”</p>

<p>And they said, “It is indeed better not to hear it.
You were so busy listening to their song that you
could not see what we saw. All the way as we
passed by the island, logs of wood and bits of masts
were floating on the water; and these must have
been pieces from ships which have been broken on
the rocks, because the sailors heard the Sirens’
song.”</p>

<h3 id="NAUSICAA_RESCUES_ULYSSES">NAUSICAA RESCUES ULYSSES</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">The King of Phæacia was Alcinoüs, and he
had five sons and one daughter, Nausicaa.
To her, where she slept with her two maidens by
her, the goddess Minerva went, taking the shape
of her friend, the daughter of Dymas, and said—</p>

<p>“Why hath thy mother so idle a daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Nausicaa? Lo! thy garments lie unwashed, and thy
wedding must be near, seeing that many nobles in
the land are suitors to thee. Ask then thy father
that he give thee the wagon with the mules, for the
laundries are far from the city, and I will go with
thee.”</p>

<p>And when the morning was come, Nausicaa
awoke, marvelling at the dream, and went seeking
her parents. Her mother she found busy with
her maidens at the loom, and her father she met as
he was going to the council with the chiefs of the
land. Then she said, “Give me, father, the wagon
with the mules, that I may take the garments to
the river to wash them. Thou shouldst always
have clean robes when thou goest to the council; and
there are my five brothers also, who love to have
newly washed garments at the dance.”</p>

<p>But of her own marriage she said nothing. And
her father, knowing her thoughts, said, “It is well.
The men shall harness the wagon for thee.”</p>

<p>So they put the clothing into the wagon. And
her mother put also food and wine, and olive oil
also, wherewith she and her maidens might anoint
themselves after the bath. So they climbed into
the wagon and went to the river. And then they
washed the clothing, and spread it out to dry on
the rocks by the sea. And after that they had
bathed and anointed themselves, they sat down to
eat and drink by the river side; and after the meal
they played at ball, singing as they played, and
Nausicaa led the song. But when they had nearly
ended their play, the princess, throwing the ball to
one of her maidens, cast it so wide that it fell into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the river. Whereupon they all cried aloud, and
Ulysses awoke. And he said to himself, “What is
this land to which I have come? Are they that
dwell therein fierce or kind to strangers? Just
now I seemed to hear the voice of nymphs, or am
I near the dwellings of men?”</p>

<p>Then he twisted leaves about his loins, and rose
up and went towards the maidens, who indeed were
frighted to see him (for he was wild of aspect), and
fled hither and thither. But Nausicaa stood and
fled not. Then Ulysses thought within himself,
should he go near and clasp her knees, or, lest haply
this should anger her, should he stand and speak?
And this he did, saying—</p>

<p>“I am thy suppliant, O queen. Whether thou
art a goddess, I know not. But if thou art a mortal,
happy thy father and mother, and happy thy
brothers, and happiest of all he who shall win thee
in marriage. Never have I seen man or woman so
fair. Thou art like a young palm-tree that but
lately I saw in Delos, springing by the temple of
the god. But as for me, I have been cast on this
shore, having come from the island Ogygia. Pity
me, then, and lead me to the city, and give me
something, a wrapper of this linen, maybe, to put
about me. So may the gods give thee all blessings!”</p>

<p>And Nausicaa made answer, “Thou seemest,
stranger, to be neither evil nor foolish; and as for
thy plight, the gods give good fortune or bad, as
they will. Thou shalt not lack clothing or food,
or anything that a suppliant should have. And I
will take thee to the city. Know also that this land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
is Phæacia, and that I am daughter to Alcinoüs,
who is king thereof.”</p>

<p>Then she called to her maidens, “What mean
ye, to flee when ye see a man? No enemy comes
hither to harm us, for we are dear to the gods; but
if one cometh here overborne by trouble, it is well
to succor him. Give this man, therefore, food
and drink, and let him wash himself in the river,
where there is shelter from the wind.”</p>

<p>So they brought him down to the river, and
gave him a tunic and a cloak to clothe himself, and
also oil-olive in a flask of gold. Then, at his bidding,
they departed a little space, and he washed
the salt from his skin and out of his hair, and
anointed himself, and put on the clothing. And
Minerva made him taller and fairer to see, and
caused the hair to be thick on his head, in color
as a hyacinth. Then he sat down on the seashore,
right beautiful to behold, and the maiden said—</p>

<p>“Not without some bidding of the gods comes
this man to our land. Before, indeed, I deemed
him uncomely, but now he seems like to the gods.
I should be well content to have such a man for
a husband, and maybe he might be willing to abide
in this land. Give him, ye maidens, food and
drink.”</p>

<p>So they gave him, and he ate ravenously, having
fasted long. Then Nausicaa bade yoke the mules,
and said to Ulysses—</p>

<p>“Follow thou with the maidens, and I will lead
the way in the wagon. For I would not that the
people should speak lightly of me. I doubt not
that were thou with me some one of the baser sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
would say, ‘Who is this stranger, tall and fair, that
cometh with Nausicaa? Will he be her husband?
Perchance it is some god, or a man from far away;
for of us men of Phæacia she thinks scorn.’ It
would be shame that such words should be spoken.
Do thou, then, follow behind, and when we are
come to the city, tarry in a poplar grove that thou
shalt see (’tis the grove of Minerva) till I shall
have come to my father’s house. Then follow; and
for the house, that any one, even a child, can show
thee, for the other Phæacians dwell not in such.
And when thou art come within the doors, pass
quickly through the hall to where my mother sits.
Close to the hearth is her seat, and my father’s hard
by, where he sits with the wine cup in his hand, as
a god. Pass him by and lay hold of her knees, and
pray her that she give thee safe return to thy
country.”</p>

<p>It was evening when they came to the city. And
Nausicaa drove the wagon to the palace. Her
brothers came out to her, and loosed the mules and
carried in the clothing. Then she went to her
chamber, where Eurymedusa, who was her nurse,
lighted a fire and prepared a meal. Meanwhile
Ulysses came from the grove, and lest any one
should see him, Minerva spread a mist about him,
and when he had now reached the city, she took
the shape of a young maiden carrying a pitcher,
and met him.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses asked her, “My child, canst thou
tell me where dwells Alcinoüs? for I am a stranger
in this place.”</p>

<p>And she answered, “I will show thee, for indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
he dwells nigh to my own father. But be thou
silent, for we Phæacians love not strangers over
much.”</p>

<p>Then she led him to the palace. A wondrous
place it was, with walls of brass and doors of
gold, hanging on posts of silver; and on either side
of the door were dogs of gold and silver, the work
of Vulcan, and against the wall, all along from the
threshold to the inner chamber, were set seats, on
which sat the chiefs of the Phæacians, feasting;
and youths wrought in gold stood holding torches
in their hands, to give light in the darkness. Fifty
women were in the house grinding corn and weaving
robes, for the women of the land are no less
skilled to weave than are the men to sail the sea.
And round about the house were gardens beautiful
with orchards of fig, and apple, and pear, and
pomegranate, and olive. Drought hurts them
not, nor frost, and harvest comes after harvest
without ceasing. Also there was a vineyard; and
some of the grapes were parching in the sun, and
some were being gathered, and some again were
but just turning red. And there were beds of all
manner of flowers; and in the midst of all were
two fountains which never failed.</p>

<p>These things Ulysses regarded for a space and
then passed into the hall. Quickly he passed and
put his hands on the knees of Areté and said—and
as he spake the mist cleared from about him,
and all that were in the hall beheld him—“I am a
suppliant to thee, and to thy husband and to thy
guests. The gods bless thee and them, and grant
you to live in peace, and that your children should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
come peacefully after you. Only, do you send me
home to my native country.”</p>

<p>And he sat down in the ashes of the hearth.
Then for a space all were silent, but at the last
spake Echeneüs, who was the oldest man in the
land—“King Alcinoüs, this ill becomes you that
this man should sit in the ashes of the hearth. Raise
him and bid him sit upon a seat, and let us pour
out to Father Jupiter, who is the friend of suppliants,
and let the keeper of the house give him
meat and drink.”</p>

<p>And Alcinoüs did so, bidding his eldest born,
Laodamas, rise from his seat. And an attendant
poured water on his hands, and the keeper of the
house gave him meat and drink. Then, when all
had poured out to Father Jupiter, King Alcinoüs
said that they would take counsel on the morrow
about sending this stranger to his home. And they
answered that it should be so, and each went to his
home.</p>

<p>Only Ulysses was left in the hall, and Alcinoüs
and Areté with him. And Areté saw his cloak
and tunic, that she and her maidens had made
them, and said—“Whence art thou, stranger? and
who gave thee these garments?”</p>

<p>So Ulysses told her how he had come from the
island of Calypso, and what he had suffered, and
how Nausicaa had found him on the shore, and
had guided him to the city.</p>

<p>But Alcinoüs blamed the maiden that she had
not herself brought him to the house. “For thou
wast her suppliant,” he said.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Ulysses; “she would have brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
me, but I would not, fearing thy wrath.” For he
would not have the maiden blamed.</p>

<p>Then said Alcinoüs, “I am not one to be angered
for such cause. Gladly would I have such a one
as thou art to be my son-in-law, and I would give
him house and wealth. But no one would I stay
against his will. And as for sending thee to thy
home, that is easy; for thou shalt sleep, and they
shall take thee meanwhile.”</p>

<p>And after this they slept. And the next day the
king called the chiefs to an assembly, and told
them of his purpose, that he would send this
stranger to his home, for that it was their wont
to show such kindness to such as needed it. And
he bade fifty and two of the younger men make
ready a ship, and that the elders should come to
his house, and bring Demodocus, the minstrel, with
them, for he was minded to make a great feast
for this stranger before he departed. So the
youths made ready the ship. And afterwards there
were gathered together a great multitude, so that
the palace was filled from the one end to the
other.</p>

<p>And Alcinoüs slew for them twelve sheep and
eight swine and two oxen. And when they had
feasted to the full, the minstrel sang to them of
how Achilles and Ulysses had striven together with
fierce words at a feast, and how King Agamemnon
was glad, seeing that so the prophecy of Apollo
was fulfilled, saying that when valor and counsel
should fall out, the end of Troy should come. But
when Ulysses heard the song, he wept, holding his
mantle before his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>This Alcinoüs perceived, and said to the chiefs,
“Now that we have feasted and delighted ourselves
with song, let us go forth, that the stranger may
see that we are skilful in boxing and wrestling and
running.”</p>

<p>So they went forth, a herald leading Demodocus
by the hand, for the minstrel was blind. Then
stood up many Phæacian youths, and the fairest
and strongest of them all was Laodamas, eldest
son to the king, and after them Euryalus. And
next they ran a race, and Clytoneus was the swiftest.
And among the wrestlers Euryalus was the
best, and of the boxers, Laodamas. And in throwing
the quoit Elatrius excelled, and in leaping at
the bar, Amphialus.</p>

<p>Then Laodamas said to Ulysses, “Father, wilt
thou not try thy skill in some game, and put away
the trouble from thy heart?”</p>

<p>But Ulysses answered, “Why askest thou this?
I think of my troubles rather than of sport and sit
among you, caring only that I may see again my
home.”</p>

<p>Then said Euryalus, “And in very truth,
stranger, thou hast not the look of a wrestler or
boxer. Rather would one judge thee to be some
trader, who sails over the sea for gain.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” answered Ulysses, “this is ill said. So
true is it that the gods give not all gifts to all
men, beauty to one and sweet speech to another.
Fair of form art thou, no god could better thee;
but thou speakest idle words. I am not unskilled
in these things, but stood among the first in the
old days; but since have I suffered much in battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and shipwreck. Yet will I make trial of my
strength, for thy words have angered me.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he took a quoit, heavier far than
such as the Phæacians were wont to throw, and sent
it with a whirl. It hurtled through the air, so that
the brave Phæacians crouched to the ground in
fear, and fell far beyond all the rest.</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, “Come now, I will contend
in wrestling or boxing, or even in the race, with
any man in Phæacia, save Laodamas only, for he
is my friend. I can shoot with the bow, and only
Philoctetes could surpass me; and I can cast a
spear as far as other men can shoot an arrow. But
as for the race, it may be that some one might outrun
me, for I have suffered much on the sea.”</p>

<p>But they all were silent, till the king stood up
and said, “Thou hast spoken well. But we men of
Phæacia are not mighty to wrestle or to box; only
we are swift of foot, and skilful to sail upon the
sea. And we love feasts, and dances, and the
harp, and gay clothing, and the bath. In these
things no man may surpass us.”</p>

<p>Then the king bade Demodocus the minstrel sing
again. And when he had done so, the king’s two
sons, Alius and Laodamas, danced together; and
afterwards they played with the ball, throwing it
into the air, cloud high, and catching it right skilfully.</p>

<p>And afterwards the king said, “Let us each give
this stranger a mantle and a tunic and a talent of
gold, and let Euryalus make his peace with words
and with a gift.”</p>

<p>And they all said that it should be so; also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Euryalus gave Ulysses a sword with a hilt of silver
and a scabbard of ivory. And after this Ulysses
went to the bath, and then they all sat down to the
feast. But as he went to the hall, Nausicaa, fair as
a goddess, met him and said—“Hail, stranger;
thou wilt remember me in thy native country, for
thou owest me thanks for thy life.”</p>

<p>And he answered, “Every day in my native
country will I remember thee, for indeed, fair
maiden, thou didst save my life.”</p>

<p>And when they were set down to the feast,
Ulysses sent a portion of the meat which the king
had caused to be set before him to the minstrel
Demodocus, with a message that he should sing to
them of the horse of wood which Epeius made,
Minerva helping him, and how Ulysses brought it
into Troy, full of men of war who should destroy
the city.</p>

<p>Then the minstrel sang how that some of the
Greeks sailed away, having set fire to their tents,
and some hid themselves in the horse with Ulysses,
and how the men of Troy sat around, taking counsel
what they should do with it, and some judged
that they should rip it open, and some that they
should throw it from the hill-top, and others again
that they should leave it to be a peace-offering to
the gods; and how the Greeks issued forth from
their lurking-place and spoiled the city, and how
Ulysses and Menelaus went to the house of
Deïphobus.</p>

<p>So he sang, and Ulysses wept to hear the tale.
And when Alcinoüs perceived that he wept, he
bade Demodocus cease from his song, for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
that were there liked it not. And to Ulysses he
said that he should tell them who was his father
and his mother, and from what land he came, and
what was his name. All these things Ulysses told
them, and all that he had done and suffered, down
to the time when the Princess Nausicaa found him
on the river shore. And when he had ended, King
Alcinoüs bade that the princess should give Ulysses
yet other gifts; and after that they went each man
to his house to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day King Alcinoüs put all the gifts
into the ship. And when the evening was come
Ulysses bade farewell to the king and to the queen,
and departed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="ULYSSES_AND_THE_SWINEHERD">ULYSSES AND THE SWINEHERD</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Now Ulysses slept while the ship was sailing to
Ithaca. And when it was come to the shore
he yet slept. Wherefore the men lifted him out,
and put him on the shore with all his goods, and so
left him. After a while he awoke, and knew not
the land, for there was a great mist about him,
Minerva having contrived that it should be so, for
good ends, as will be seen. Very wroth was he
with the men of Phæacia, thinking that they had
cheated him; nor did it comfort him when he
counted his goods to find that of these he had lost
nothing.</p>

<p>But as he walked by the sea, lamenting his fate,
Minerva met him, having the shape of a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
shepherd; and Ulysses, when he saw him, was glad,
and asked him how men called the country wherein
he was.</p>

<p>And the false shepherd said, “Thou art foolish,
or, may be, hast come from very far, not to know
this country. Rocky it is, not fit for horses; nor is
it very broad; but it is fertile land, and full of
wine; nor does it want for rain, and a good pasture
it is for oxen and goats; and men call it Ithaca.
Even in Troy, which is very far, they say, from this
land of Greece, men have heard of Ithaca.”</p>

<p>This Ulysses was right glad to hear. Yet he
was not minded to say who he was, but rather to
make up a tale.</p>

<p>So he said, “Yes, of a truth, I heard of this
Ithaca in Crete, from which I am newly come
with all this wealth, leaving also as much behind
for my children. I made covenant with certain
Phæacians that they should take me to Pylos or to
Elis; which thing indeed they were minded to do,
only the wind drove them hither, and while I slept
they put me upon the shore and departed to Sidon.”</p>

<p>This pleased Minerva much, and she changed
her shape, becoming like a woman, tall and fair,
and said to Ulysses—“Right cunning would he be
who could cheat thee. Even now in thy native
country ceasest thou not from cunning words and
deceits! But let these things be; for thou art the
wisest of mortal men, and I excel among the gods
in counsel. I am Minerva, daughter of Jupiter,
who am ever wont to stand by thee and help thee.
And now we will hide these possessions of thine;
and thou must be silent, nor tell to any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
thou art, and endure many things, so that thou
mayest come to thine own again.”</p>

<p>But still Ulysses doubted, and would have the
goddess tell him whether of a truth he had come
back to his native land. And she, commending
his prudence, scattered the mist that was about
him. Then Ulysses knew the land, and kissed the
ground, and prayed to the nymphs that they
would be favorable to him. And after this, Minerva
guiding him, he hid away his possessions in
a cave, and put a great stone on the mouth. Then
the two took counsel together.</p>

<p>And Minerva said, “Think, man of many devices,
how thou wilt lay hands on these men, suitors
of thy wife, who for three years have sat in thy
house devouring thy substance. She hath answered
them craftily, making many promises, but still
hoping for thy coming.”</p>

<p>Then Ulysses said, “Truly I had perished, even
as Agamemnon perished, but for thee. But do
thou help me, as of old in Troy, for with thee at
my side I would fight with three hundred men.”</p>

<p>Then said Minerva, “Lo! I will cause that no
man shall know thee. The suitors shall take no
account of thee, neither shall thy wife nor thy
son know thee. But go to the swineherd Eumæus,
where he dwells by the fountain of Arethusa, for
he is faithful to thee and to thy house. And I will
hasten to Sparta, to the house of Menelaus, to
fetch Telemachus, thy son, for he went thither,
seeking news of thee.”</p>

<p>Then Minerva changed him into the shape of a
beggar-man. She caused his skin to wither, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
his hair to fall off, and his eyes to grow dim, and
put on him filthy rags, with a great stag’s hide
about his shoulders, and in his hand a staff, and a
wallet on his shoulder, fastened by a rope.</p>

<p>Then she departed, and Ulysses went to the
house of Eumæus, the swineherd. A great courtyard
there was, and twelve sties for the sows, and
four watchdogs, big as wild beasts, for such did
the swineherd breed. He himself was shaping sandals,
and of his men three were with the swine in
the fields, and one was driving a fat beast to the
city, to be meat for the suitors. When Ulysses
came near, the dogs ran upon him, but the swineherd
ran forth and drove away the dogs, and
brought the old man in, and gave him a seat of
brushwood, with a great goat-skin over it.</p>

<p>The two talked of matters in Ithaca, and
Eumæus told how the suitors of the queen were
devouring the substance of Ulysses. Then the
false beggar asked him of the king, saying that
perchance, having travelled far, he might know
such an one.</p>

<p>But Eumæus said, “Nay, old man, thus do all
wayfarers talk, yet we hear no truth from them.
Not a vagabond fellow comes to this island but our
queen must see him, and ask him many things,
weeping the while. And thou, I doubt not, for a
cloak or a tunic, would tell a wondrous tale. But
Ulysses, I know, is dead, and either the fowls of
the air devour him or the fishes of the sea.”</p>

<p>And when the false beggar would have comforted
him, saying he knew of a truth that
Ulysses would yet return, he hearkened not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Moreover, he prophesied evil for Telemachus also,
who had gone to seek news of his father, but would
surely be slain by the suitors, who were even now
lying in wait for him as he should return. And
after this he asked the stranger who he was and
whence he had come. Then Ulysses answered him
craftily, inventing another story.</p>

<p>After this they talked much, and when the
swineherd’s men were returned they all feasted together.
And the night being cold, and there being
much rain, Ulysses was minded to see whether one
would lend him a cloak; wherefore he told this
tale—</p>

<p>“Once upon a time there was laid an ambush
near to the city of Troy. And Menelaus and
Ulysses and I were the leaders of it. In the reeds
we sat and the night was cold and the snow lay
upon our shields. Now all the others had cloaks,
but I had left mine behind at the ships. So when
the night was three parts spent I spake to Ulysses,
‘Here am I without a cloak; soon, methinks, shall
I perish with the cold.’ Soon did he bethink him
of a remedy, for he was ever ready with counsel.
Therefore to me he said, ‘Hush, lest some one hear
thee,’ and to the others, ‘I have been warned in a
dream. We are very far from the ships, and in
peril. Wherefore let some one run to the ships to
King Agamemnon, that he send more men to help.’
Then Thoas, son of Andræmon, rose up and ran,
casting off his cloak, and this I took, and slept
warmly therein. Were I this night such as then I
was, I should not lack such kindness even now.”</p>

<p>Then said Eumæus, “This is well spoken, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
man. Thou shalt have a cloak to cover thee. But
in the morning, thou must put on thy own rags
again. Yet perchance, when the son of Ulysses
shall come, he will give thee new garments.”</p>

<p>After this they slept, but Eumæus tarried without,
keeping watch over the swine.</p>

<h3 id="THE_RETURN_OF_TELEMACHUS">THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Now all this time Telemachus tarried in Sparta
with King Menelaus. To him went Minerva
and warned him that he should return to his home.
Also she warned him that the suitors had laid an
ambush to slay him in the strait between Samos
and Ithaca, and that he should keep clear of the
island; and as soon as ever he came near to Ithaca
he should land and go to the swineherd Eumæus,
and send him to his mother, with tidings of his
being safely arrived.</p>

<p>Then they departed. And when they were come
to Ithaca, Telemachus bade the men take the ship
to the city, saying that he was minded to see his
farms, but that in the evening he would come to the
city, but Telemachus went to the dwelling of the
swineherd Eumæus. And Ulysses heard the steps
of a man, and, as the dogs barked not, said to
Eumæus, “Lo! there comes some comrade or friend,
for the dogs bark not.”</p>

<p>And as he spake, Telemachus stood in the doorway,
and the swineherd let fall from his hand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
bowl in which he was mixing wine, and ran to him
and kissed his head and his eyes and his hands. As
a father kisses his only son coming back to him from
a far country after ten years, so did the swineherd
kiss Telemachus. And when Telemachus came in,
the false beggar rose, and would have given place
to him; but Telemachus suffered him not.</p>

<p>And when they had eaten and drunk, Telemachus
asked of the swineherd who this stranger
might be.</p>

<p>Then the swineherd told him as he had heard,
and afterwards said, “I hand him to thee; he is
thy suppliant: do as thou wilt.”</p>

<p>But Telemachus answered, “Nay, Eumæus.
For am I master in my house? Do not the suitors
devour it? I will give this stranger, indeed, food
and clothing and a sword, and will send him whithersoever
he will, but I would not that he should
go among the suitors, so haughty are they and
violent.”</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, “But why dost thou bear with
these men? Do the people hate thee, that thou canst
not avenge thyself on them? and hast thou not
kinsmen to help thee? As for me, I would rather
die than see such shameful things done in house
of mine.”</p>

<p>And Telemachus answered, “My people hate
me not; but as for kinsmen, I have none, for
Ulysses had no other son but me. Therefore do
these men spoil my substance, and, it may be, will
take my life also. These things, however, the gods
will order. But do thou, Eumæus, go to Penelope,
and tell her that I am returned, but let no man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
know thereof, for there are that counsel evil
against me; but I will stay here meanwhile.”</p>

<p>So Eumæus departed. But when he had gone
Minerva came, like a woman tall and fair; but
Telemachus saw her not, for it is not given to all
to see the immortal gods; but Ulysses saw her, and
the dogs saw her, and whimpered for fear. She
signed to Ulysses, and he went forth, and she
said—</p>

<p>“Hide not the matter from thy son, but plan
with him how ye may slay the suitors, and lo! I
am with you.”</p>

<p>Then she made his garments white and fair and
his body lusty and strong, and his face swarthy,
and his cheeks full, and his beard black. And when
he was returned to the house, Telemachus marvelled
to see him, and said—</p>

<p>“Thou art not what thou wast. Surely thou art
some god from heaven.”</p>

<p>But Ulysses made reply, “No god am I, only thy
father, whom thou hast so desired to see.”</p>

<p>And when Telemachus yet doubted, Ulysses told
him how Minerva had so changed him. Then
Telemachus threw his arms about him, weeping,
and both wept together for a while. And afterwards
Telemachus asked him of his coming back.
And Ulysses, when he had told him of this, asked
him how many were the suitors, and whether they
two could fight with them alone.</p>

<p>Then said Telemachus, “Thou art, I know, a
great warrior, my father, and a wise, but this thing
we cannot do; for these men are not ten, no, nor
twice ten, but from Dulichium come fifty and two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and from Samos four and twenty, and from Zacynthus
twenty, and from Ithaca twelve; and they
have Medon the herald, and a minstrel also, and
attendants.”</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, “Go thou home in the morning
and mingle with the suitors, and I will come as
an old beggar; and if they treat me shamefully,
endure it, yea, if they drag me to the door. Heed
this also: when I give thee the token, take all the
arms from the dwelling and hide them in thy
chamber. And when they shall ask thee why thou
doest thus, say thou takest them out of the smoke,
for they are not such as Ulysses left behind him
when he went to Troy, but that the smoke had soiled
them. But keep two swords and two spears and
two shields—these shall be for thee and me. Only
let no one know of my coming back—not Laertes,
nor the swineherd, no, nor Penelope herself.”</p>

<p>After a while the swineherd came back from the
city, having carried his tidings to the queen. And
this she also had heard from the sailors of the ships.
And the suitors were in great wrath and fear, because
their purpose had failed, and also because
Penelope the queen knew what they had been
minded to do, and hated them because of it.</p>

<h3 id="ULYSSES_IN_HIS_HOME">ULYSSES IN HIS HOME</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">The next day Telemachus went to the city.
Before he went he said to Eumæus that he
should bring the beggar-man to the city, for that
it was better to beg in the city than in the country.
The false beggar also said that he wished this.
And Telemachus went to the palace and greeted
the nurse Euryclea and his mother Penelope, who
was right glad to see him, but to whom he told
nought of what had happened.</p>

<p>Now in the meanwhile Eumæus and the false
beggar were coming to the city. And when they
were now near to it, by the fountain which Ithacus
and his brethren had made, where was also an
altar of the nymphs, Melanthius the goatherd met
them, and spake evil to Eumæus, rebuking him that
he brought this beggar to the city. And he came
near and smote Ulysses with his foot on the thigh,
but moved him not from the path. And Ulysses
thought a while, should he smite him with his club
and slay him, or dash him on the ground? But it
seemed to him better to endure.</p>

<p>So they went on to the palace. And at the door
of the court there lay the dog Argus, whom in the
old days Ulysses had reared with his own hand.
But ere the dog grew to his full, Ulysses had sailed
to Troy. And, while he was strong, men used him
in the chase, hunting wild goats and roe-deer and
hares. But now he was old and lay neglected in a
corner. Well he knew his master, and, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
could not come near him, he wagged his tail and
drooped his ears.</p>

<p>And Ulysses, when he saw him, wiped away a
tear, and said, “Surely this is strange, Eumæus, that
such a dog, being of so fine a breed, should lie here
uncared for.”</p>

<p>And Eumæus made reply, “He belongeth to a
master who died far away. For indeed when
Ulysses had him of old, he was the strongest and
swiftest of dogs; but now my dear lord has perished
far away, and the careless women tend him not.”
And as he spake the dog Argus died. Twenty
years had he waited, and he saw his master at the
last.</p>

<p>After this the two entered the hall. And Telemachus,
when he saw them, took from the basket
bread and meat, as much as his hands could hold,
and bade carry them to the beggar, and also to
tell him that he might go round among the suitors,
asking alms. So he went, stretching out his hand,
as though he were wont to beg; and some gave,
having compassion upon him and marvelling at
him, and some asked who he was. But of all,
Antinoüs was the most shameless. For when
Ulysses came to him and told him how he had had
much riches and power in former days, and how he
had gone to Egypt, and had been sold a slave into
Cyprus, Antinoüs mocked him, saying—</p>

<p>“Get thee from my table, or thou shalt find a
worse Egypt and a harder Cyprus than before.”</p>

<p>Then Ulysses said, “Surely thy soul is evil
though thy body is fair; for though thou sittest at
another man’s feast, yet wilt thou give me nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>But Antinoüs, in great wrath, took the stool on
which he sat and cast it at him, smiting his right
shoulder. Ulysses stirred not, but stood as a rock.
But in his heart he thought on revenge. So he went
and sat down at the door. And being there, he said,
“Hear me, suitors of the queen! There is no wrath
if a man be smitten fighting for that which is his
own, but Antinoüs has smitten me because I am
poor. May the curse of the hungry light on him
therefore, ere he come to his marriage day.”</p>

<p>And the other suitors blamed him that he had
dealt so cruelly with this stranger, and the queen
was wroth when she heard it, as she sat in the upper
chamber with her maidens about her.</p>

<p>But as the day passed on there came a beggar
from the city, huge of bulk, mighty to eat and drink,
but his strength was not according to his size.
Arnæus was his name, but the young men called
him Irus, because he was their messenger, after
Iris, the messenger of Jupiter. He spake to
Ulysses, “Give space, old man, lest I drag thee
forth. The young men would even now have it so,
but I think it shame to strike such an one as thee.”</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, “There is room for thee and
for me; get what thou canst, for I do not grudge
thee aught, but beware lest thou anger me, lest I
harm thee, old though I am.” But Irus would not
hear words of peace, and still challenged him to
fight.</p>

<p>When Antinoüs saw this he was glad, and said,
“This is the goodliest sport that I have seen in
this house. These two beggars would fight; let us
haste and match them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>And the saying pleased them; and Antinoüs
spake again: “Hear me, ye suitors of the queen!
We have put aside these paunches of the goats for
our supper. Let us agree that whosoever of these
two shall win, have choice of these, that which
pleaseth him best, and shall hereafter eat with us,
and that no one else shall sit in his place.”</p>

<p>Then said Ulysses, “It is hard for an old man
to fight with a young. Yet will I do it. Only do
ye swear to me that no one shall strike me a foul
blow while I fight with this man.”</p>

<p>Then Telemachus said that this should be so, and
they all consented to his words. Then Ulysses
girded himself for the fight. All that were there
saw his thighs, how great and strong they were, and
his shoulders, how broad, and his arms, how mighty.
And they said one to another, “There will be little
of Irus left, so stalwart seems this beggar-man.”
Irus would have slunk out of sight, but they compelled
him to come forth.</p>

<p>Then said the Prince Antinoüs, “How is this,
thou braggart, that thou fearest this old man, all
woe-begone as he is? Hearken thou to this. If
this man prevails against thee, thou shalt be cast
into a ship and taken to the land of King Echetus,
who will cut off thy ears and thy nose.”</p>

<p>So the two came together. And Ulysses thought
whether he should strike the fellow and slay him
out of hand, or fell him to the ground. And this
last seemed the better of the two. So when Irus
had dealt his blow, he smote him on the jaw, so
that he fell howling on the ground.</p>

<p>Then all the suitors laughed aloud. But Ulysses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
dragged him out of the hall, and propped him by
the wall of the courtyard, putting a staff in his hand
and saying, “Sit there, and keep dogs and swine
from the door, but dare not hereafter to lord it
over men, lest some worse thing befall thee.”</p>

<p>Then Antinoüs gave him a great paunch, and
Amphinomus gave two loaves, and pledged him
in a cup, saying, “Good luck to thee, father, hereafter,
though now thou seemest to have evil
fortune.”</p>

<p>And Ulysses made reply, “O Amphinomus, thou
hast much wisdom, methinks, and thy father I
know, is wise. Take heed, therefore. There is
nought feebler upon earth than man. For in the
days of his prosperity he thinketh nothing of
trouble, but when the gods send evil to him there is
no help in him. I also trusted once in myself and
my kinsmen, and now—behold me what I am! Let
no man, therefore, do violence and wrong, for
Jupiter shall punish such deeds at the last. These
suitors of the queen are working evil to him who is
absent. Yet will he return some day and slay his
enemies. Fly thou, therefore, while yet there is
time, nor meet him when he comes.”</p>

<p>So he spake, with kindly thought.</p>

<p>That evening, the suitors having departed to their
own dwellings, Ulysses and Telemachus took the
arms from the hall, as they had planned to do. And
while they did so Telemachus said, “See, my father,
this marvellous brightness that is on the pillars and
the ceiling. Surely some god is with us.”</p>

<p>And Ulysses made reply, “I know it: be silent.
And now go to thy chamber and sleep, and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
me here, for I have somewhat to say to thy mother
and her maidens.”</p>

<p>When the queen and her maidens came into the
hall (for it was their work to cleanse it and make
it ready for the morrow) Penelope asked him of his
family and his country. At first he made as though
he would not answer, fearing lest he should trouble
her with the story of that which he had suffered.
But afterwards, for she urged him, telling him what
she herself had suffered, her husband being lost and
her suitors troubling her without ceasing, he made
up a tale that should satisfy her. He told her that
he was a man of Crete, a brother of King Idomeneus,
and how he had given hospitality to
Ulysses when he was sailing to Troy with the sons
of Atreus.</p>

<p>And when the queen, seeking to know whether he
spake the truth, asked him of Ulysses what manner
of man he was, and with what clothing he was
clothed, he answered her rightly, saying, “I remember
me that he had a mantle, twofold, woolen, of
sea-purple, clasped with a brooch of gold, whereon
was a dog that held a fawn by the throat; marvellously
wrought they were, so hard held the one,
so strove the other to be free. Also he had a tunic,
white and smooth, which the women much admired.
But whether some one had given him these things
I know not, for indeed many gave him gifts. Also
he had a herald with him, one Eurybates, older than
him, dark-skinned, round in the shoulders, with
curly hair.”</p>

<p>And Penelope, knowing these things to be true,
wept aloud, crying that she should see her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
no more. The false beggar comforted her, saying
that Ulysses was in the land of Thresprotians,
having much wealth with him, only that he had lost
his ships and comrades, yet nevertheless would
speedily return.</p>

<p>Then Penelope bade her servants make ready a
bed for the stranger of soft mats and blankets, and
prepare a bath for him. But the mats and blankets
he would not have, saying that he would sleep as
before. Wherefore the queen bade Euryclea, the
keeper of the house, do this thing for him, saying
that he had been the comrade of her lord, and was
marvellously like to him in feet and hands.</p>

<p>And this the old woman was right willing to do,
for love of her master, “for never,” she said, “of all
strangers that had come to the land, had come one
so like to him.”</p>

<p>When she had prepared the bath for his feet,
Ulysses sat by the fire, but as far in the shadow
as he could, lest the old woman should see a
great scar that was upon his leg, and know him
thereby.</p>

<p>By this scar the old nurse knew that it was
Ulysses himself, and said, “O Ulysses, O my child,
to think that I knew thee not!”</p>

<p>And she looked towards the queen, meaning to
tell the thing to her. But Ulysses laid his hand on
her throat, “Mother, wouldst thou kill me? I am
returned after twenty years; and none must know
till I shall be ready to take vengeance.”</p>

<p>And the old woman held her peace. And after
this Penelope talked with him again, telling him
her dreams, how she had seen a flock of geese in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
her palace, and how that an eagle had slain them,
and when she mourned for these geese, lo! a voice
said, “These geese are thy suitors, and the eagle thy
husband.”</p>

<p>And Ulysses said that the dream was well. Then
she said that on the morrow she must make her
choice, for she had promised to bring forth the great
bow that was Ulysses’, and whosoever should draw
it most easily, and shoot an arrow best at a mark,
should be her husband.</p>

<p>And Ulysses made answer to her, “It is well,
lady. Put not off this trial of the bow, for before
one of them shall draw the string the great Ulysses
shall come and duly shoot at the mark that shall
be set.”</p>

<p>After this Penelope slept, but Ulysses watched.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="THE_TRIAL_OF_THE_BOW">THE TRIAL OF THE BOW</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">The next day many things cheered Ulysses for
that which he had to do; for first the goddess
Minerva had told him that she would stand at his
side, and next he heard the thunder of Jupiter in a
clear sky, and at last it chanced that a woman who
sat at the mill grinding corn, being sore weary of
her task, and hating the suitors, said, “Grant
Father Jupiter, that this be the last meal which
these men shall eat in the house of Ulysses!”</p>

<p>After a while the suitors came and sat down, as
was their wont, to the feast, and the servants bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
to Ulysses, as Telemachus had bidden, a full share
with the others. When Ctesippus, a prince of
Samos, saw this, he said, “Is it well that this fellow
should fare even as we? Look now at the gift that
I shall give him.” Whereupon he took a bullock’s
foot out of the basket wherein it lay, and cast it at
Ulysses.</p>

<p>But he moved his head to the left and shunned it,
and it flew on, marking the wall. And Telemachus
cried in great wrath, “It is well for thee, Ctesippus,
that thou didst not strike this stranger. For surely,
hadst thou done this thing, my spear had pierced
thee through, and thy father had made good cheer,
not for thy marriage, but for thy burial.”</p>

<p>Then said Agelaus, “This is well said. Telemachus
should not be wronged, no, nor this
stranger. But, on the other hand, he must bid his
mother choose out of the suitors whom she will, and
marry him, nor waste our time any more.”</p>

<p>And Telemachus said, “It is well. She may
marry whom she will. But from my house I will
never send her against her will.” And the suitors
laughed, and scoffed at Telemachus, but he heeded
them not, and sat waiting till his father should give
the sign.</p>

<p>Alter this Penelope went to fetch the great bow
of Ulysses. From the peg on which it hung she
took it with its sheath, and sitting down, she laid
it on her knees and wept over it, and after this rose
up and went to where the suitors sat feasting in
the hall. The bow she brought, and also the quiver
full of arrows, and standing by the pillar of the
dome, spake thus—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye suitors who devour this house, making pretence
that ye wish to wed me, lo! here is a proof
of your skill. Here is the bow of the great Ulysses.
Whoso shall bend it easiest in his hands, and shoot
an arrow most easily through the helve-holes of
the twelve axes that Telemachus shall set up, him
will I follow, leaving this house, which I shall
remember only in my dreams.”</p>

<p>Then she bade Eumæus bear the bow and the
arrows to the suitors. And the good swineherd
wept to see his master’s bow, and Philætius, the
herdsman of the kine, wept also, for he was a good
man, and loved the house of Ulysses. Then Telemachus
planted in due order the axes wherein were
the helve-holes.</p>

<p>Then first Leiodes, the priest, who alone among
the suitors hated their evil ways, made trial of the
bow. But he moved it not. It wearied his hands,
for they were tender, and unwont to toil. And he
said, “I cannot bend this bow; let some other try.”</p>

<p>Antinoüs was wroth to hear such words, and bade
Melanthius bring forth from the stores a roll of
fat, that they might anoint the string and soften it.
So they softened the string with fat, but could not
bend it, and they tried all of them in vain, till only
Antinoüs and Eurymachus were left, who indeed
were the bravest and the strongest of them all.</p>

<p>Now the swineherd and the herdsman of the kine
had gone out of the yard, and Ulysses came behind
them and said, “What would ye do if Ulysses were
to come back to his home? Would ye fight for him,
or for the suitors?”</p>

<p>And both said that they would fight for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>And Ulysses said, “It is even I who am come
back in the twentieth year, and ye, I know, are glad
at heart that I am come; nor know I of any one
besides. And if ye will help me as brave men
to-day, wives shall ye have, and possessions and
houses near to mine own. And ye shall be brothers
and comrades to Telemachus. And for a sign,
behold this scar, which the wild boar made when I
hunted with my father Autolycus.”</p>

<p>Then they wept for joy and kissed Ulysses, and
he also kissed them. And he said to Eumæus that
he should bring the bow to him when the suitors
had tried their fortune; also that he should bid the
women keep within doors, not stir out if they should
hear the noise of battle. And Philætius he bade
lock the doors of the hall and fasten them with a
rope.</p>

<p>After this he came back to the hall, and Eurymachus
had the bow in his hands, and sought to
warm it at the fire. Then he essayed to draw it, but
could not.</p>

<p>And he groaned aloud, saying, “Woe is me!
not for loss of this marriage only, for there are
other women to be wooed in Greece, but that we are
so much weaker than the great Ulysses. This is
indeed a shame to tell.”</p>

<p>Then said Antinoüs, “Not so; to-day is a holy
day of the God of Archers; therefore we could not
draw the bow. But to-morrow will we try once
more, after due sacrifice to Apollo.”</p>

<p>And this saying pleased them all; but Ulysses
said, “Let me try this bow, for I would fain know
whether I have such strength as I had in former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
days.” At this all the suitors were wroth, and
chiefly Antinoüs, but Penelope said that it should
be so, and promised the man great gifts if he could
draw his bow.</p>

<p>But Telemachus spake thus, “Mother, the bow is
mine to give or to refuse. And no man shall say
me nay, if I will that this stranger make trial
of it. But do thou go to thy chamber with thy
maidens, and let men take thought for these
things.”</p>

<p>This he said, for he would have her depart from
the hall, knowing what would happen therein. She
marvelled to hear him speak with such authority,
and answered not, but departed. And when
Eumæus would have carried the bow to Ulysses, the
suitors spake roughly to him, but Telemachus constrained
him to go. Therefore he took the bow and
gave it to his master. Then went he to Euryclea,
and bade her shut the door of the women’s chambers
and keep them within, whatsoever they might
hear. Philætius shut the doors of the hall, and
fastened with a rope.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses handled the great bow, trying it.
When he found it to be without flaw, just as a minstrel
fastens a string upon his harp and strains it
to the pitch, so he strung the bow without toil; and
holding the string in his right hand, he tried its tone,
and the tone was sweet as the voice of a swallow.
Then he took an arrow from the quiver, and laid
the notch upon the string and drew it, sitting as he
was, and the arrow passed through every ring, and
stood in the wall beyond. Then he said to Telemachus—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is yet a feast to be held before the sun go
down.”</p>

<p>And he nodded the sign to Telemachus. And
forthwith the young man stood by him, armed with
spear and helmet and shield.</p>

<h3 id="THE_VENGEANCE_OF_ULYSSES">THE VENGEANCE OF ULYSSES</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Then spake he to the suitors, “This labor
has been accomplished. Let me try at yet
another mark.”</p>

<p>And he aimed his arrow at Antinoüs. The man
was just raising a cup to his lips, thinking not of
death, for who thought that any man, though
mightiest of mortals, would venture on such a deed,
being one among many? Right through the neck
passed the arrow-head, and he dropped the cup and
fell from the table.</p>

<p>The suitors, when they saw him fall, leapt from
their seats; but when they looked, there was neither
spear nor shield upon the wall. And they knew
not whether it was by chance or of set purpose that
the stranger had smitten him. Ulysses then declared
who he was, saying—</p>

<p>“Dogs, ye thought that I would never come
back. Therefore have ye devoured my house, and
made suit to my wife while I yet lived, and feared
not the gods nor regarded men. Therefore a sudden
destruction is come upon you all.”</p>

<p>Then when all the others trembled for fear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Eurymachus said, “If thou be indeed Ulysses of
Ithaca, thou hast said well. Foul wrong has been
done to thee in the house and in the field. But
lo! he who was the mover of it all lies here, even
Antinoüs. Nor was it so much this marriage that
he sought as to be king of this land, having destroyed
thy house. But we will pay thee back
for all that we have devoured, even twenty times
as much.”</p>

<p>But Ulysses said, “Speak not of paying back.
My hands shall not cease from slaying till I have
taken vengeance on you all.”</p>

<p>Then said Eurymachus to his comrades, “This
man will not stay his hands. He will smite us all
with his arrows where he stands. Let us win the
door, and raise a cry in the city; then will this
archer have shot his last.”</p>

<p>And he rushed on, with his two-edged knife in
his hand. But as he rushed, Ulysses smote him on
the breast with an arrow, and he fell forwards.
And when Amphinomus came on, Telemachus
slew him with his spear, but drew not the spear
from the body, lest some one should smite him
unawares.</p>

<p>Then he ran to his father and said, “Shall I
fetch arms for us and our helpers?”</p>

<p>“Yea,” said he, “and tarry not, lest my arrows
be spent.”</p>

<p>So he fetched from the armory four shields
and four helmets and eight spears. And he and
the servants, Eumæus and Philætius, armed themselves.
Ulysses also, when his arrows were spent,
donned helmet and shield and took a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
spear in each hand. Melanthius, the goatherd,
crept up to the armory and brought down therefrom
twelve helmets and shields and spears.
And when Ulysses saw that the suitors were arming
themselves, he feared greatly, and said to his
son—</p>

<p>“There is treachery here. It is one of the women,
or, it may be, Melanthius, the goatherd.”</p>

<p>And Telemachus said, “This fault is mine, my
father, for I left the door of the chamber unfastened.”</p>

<p>Soon Eumæus spied Melanthius stealing up to
the chamber again, and followed him, and Philætius
with him.</p>

<p>There they caught him, as he took a helmet
in one hand and a shield in the other, and bound
his feet and hands.</p>

<p>Then these two went back to the hall, and there
also came Minerva, having the shape of Mentor.
Still, for she would yet further try the courage of
Ulysses and his son, she helped them not as yet,
but changing her shape, sat on the roof-beam like
unto a swallow.</p>

<p>And then cried Agelaus, “Friends, Mentor is
gone, and helps them not. Let us not cast our
spears at random, but let six come on together, if
perchance we may prevail against them.”</p>

<p>Then they cast their spears, but Minerva turned
them aside, one to the pillar and another to the
door and another to the wall. But Ulysses and
Telemachus and the two herdsmen slew each his
man; and yet again they did so, and again. And
all the while Minerva waved her flaming shield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
from above, and the suitors fell as birds are scattered
and torn by eagles.</p>

<p>Then Leiodes, the priest, made supplication to
Ulysses, saying, “I never wrought evil in this house,
and would have kept others from it, but they would
not. Naught have I done save serve at the altar;
wherefore slay me not.”</p>

<p>And Ulysses made reply, “That thou hast served
at the altar of these men is enough, and also that
thou wouldst wed my wife.” So he slew him; but
Phemius, the minstrel, he spared, for he had sung
among the suitors in the hall, of compulsion, and
not of good will; and also Medon, the herald, bidding
them go into the yard. There they sat, holding
by the altar and looking fearfully every way,
for yet they feared that they should die.</p>

<p>And now Ulysses bade cleanse the hall and wash
the benches and the tables with water, and purify
them with sulphur; and when this was done, that
Euryclea, the nurse, should go to Penelope and tell
her that her husband was indeed returned. So
Euryclea went to her chamber and found the queen
newly awoke from slumber, and told her that her
husband was returned, and how he had slain the
suitors, and how she had known him by the scar
where the wild boar had wounded him.</p>

<p>And yet the queen doubted, and said, “Let me
go down and see my son, and these men that are
slain, and the man who slew them.”</p>

<p>So she went, and sat in the twilight by the other
wall, and Ulysses sat by the pillar, with eyes cast
down, waiting till his wife should speak to him.
She was sore perplexed; for now she seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
know him, and now she knew him not, for he had
not suffered that the women should put new robes
upon him.</p>

<p>And Telemachus said, “Mother, sittest thou
apart from my father, and speakest not to him?
Surely thy heart is harder than a stone.”</p>

<p>But Ulysses said, “Let be, Telemachus. Thy
mother will know that which is true in good time.
But now let us hide this slaughter for a while, lest
the friends of these men seek vengeance against
us. Wherefore let there be music and dancing in
the hall, so that men shall say, ‘This is the wedding
of the queen, and there is joy in the palace,’ and
know not of the truth.”</p>

<p>So the minstrel played and women danced. And
meanwhile Ulysses went to the bath, and clothed
himself in bright apparel, and came back to the
hall, and Minerva made him fair and young to
see. Then he sat him down as before, near his wife,
and said—</p>

<p>“Surely, O lady, the gods have made thee harder
of heart than all women besides. Would other
wife have kept away from her husband, coming
back now after twenty years?”</p>

<p>And when she doubted yet, he spake again.
“Hear thou this, Penelope, and know that it is I
myself, and not another. Dost thou remember
how I built up the bed in our chamber? In the
court there grew an olive tree, stout as a pillar,
and round it I built a chamber of stone, and
spanned the chamber with a roof; and I hung also
a door, and then I cut off the leaves of the olive,
and planed the trunk, to be smooth and round; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
the bed I inlaid with ivory and silver and gold,
and stretched upon it an ox-hide that was ornamented
with silver.”</p>

<p>Then Penelope knew that he was her husband
indeed, and ran to him, and threw her arms about
him and kissed him, saying, “Pardon me, my lord,
if I was slow to know thee; for I feared, so many
wiles have men, that some one would deceive me,
saying that he was my husband. But now I know
this, that thou art he and not another.”</p>

<p>And they wept over each other and kissed each
other. So did Ulysses come back to his home after
twenty years.</p>

<h3 id="THE_REMNANT_OF_THE_DEFEATED">THE REMNANT OF THE DEFEATED
ARMY SEEKS A NEW HOME</h3>

<p class="author">By Thomas Bulfinch and Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">We have followed one of the Grecian heroes,
Ulysses, in his wanderings on his return
home from Troy, and now we propose to share the
fortunes of the remnant of the <em>conquered</em> people,
under their chief Æneas, in their search for a new
home, after the ruin of their native city.</p>

<p>On that fatal night when the wooden horse disgorged
its contents of armed men, and the capture
and conflagration of the city were the result, Æneas
beheld these things, but could not help them, being
one against many. But when he saw King Priam
lying dead before him, and Troy in flames, he bethought
him of his father Anchises, and his wife
Creüsa, and of his little son Ascanius, and how he
had left them without defense at home. But as he
turned to seek them, the night being now, by reason
of many fires, as clear as the day, he espied Helen
sitting in the temple of Vesta, where she had sought
sanctuary; for she feared the men of Troy, to whom
she had brought ruin and destruction, and not less
her own husband, whom she had deceived.</p>

<p>Then was his wrath kindled, and he spake to himself,
“Shall this evil woman return safe to Sparta?
Shall she see again her home and her children, with
Trojan women to be her hand-maidens? Shall
Troy be burnt and King Priam be slain, and she
take no harm? Not so; for though there be no glory
to be won from such a deed, yet shall I satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
myself, taking vengeance upon her for my kinsmen
and my countrymen.” But while he thought
these things in his heart, lo! there appeared unto
him Venus, his mother, as fair and as tall as the
dwellers in heaven behold her. Then Venus spake
thus, “What meaneth all this rage, my son? Hast
thou no care for me? Hast thou forgotten thy
father Anchises, and thy wife, and thy little son?
Of a surety the fire and the sword had consumed
them long since, but that I cared for them and
saved them. It is not Helen; no, nor Paris, that
hath laid low this great city of Troy, but the wrath
of the gods. See now, for I will take away the mist
that covers thine eyes; see how Neptune with his
trident is overthrowing the walls and rooting up the
city from its foundations; and how Juno stands
with spear and shield in the Scæan Gate, and calls
fresh hosts from the ships; and how Pallas sits on
the height with the storm-cloud about her and her
Gorgon shield; and how Father Jupiter himself
stirs up the enemy against Troy. Fly, therefore,
my son. I will not leave thee till thou shalt reach
thy father’s house.” And as she spake she vanished
in the darkness.</p>

<p>Then did Æneas see dreadful forms and gods
who were the enemies of Troy, and before his eyes
the whole city seemed to sink down into the fire.
Even as a mountain oak upon the hills on which
the woodmen ply their axes bows its head while all
its boughs shake about it, till at last, as blow comes
after blow, with a mighty groan it falls crashing
down from the height, even so the city seemed to
fall. Then did Æneas pass on his way, the goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
leading him, and the flames gave place to him,
and the javelins harmed him not.</p>

<p>But when he was come to his house he bethought
him first of the old man his father; but when he
would have carried him to the hills, Anchises would
not, being loath to live in some strange country
when Troy had perished. “Nay,” said he, “fly ye
who are strong and in the flower of your days. But
as for me, if the gods had willed that I should live,
they had saved this dwelling for me. Enough it is,
yea, and more than enough, that once I have seen
this city taken, and lived. Bid me, then, farewell
as though I were dead. Death will I find for myself.
And truly I have long lingered here a useless
stock and hated of the gods since Jupiter smote me
with the blast of his thunder.”</p>

<p>Nor could the old man be moved from his purpose,
though his son and his son’s wife, and even the
child Ascanius, besought him with many tears that
he should not make yet heavier the doom that was
upon them. Then was Æneas minded to go back
to the battle and die. For what hope was left?
“Thoughtest thou, my father,” he cried, “that I
should flee and leave thee behind? What evil word
is this that has fallen from thy lips? If the gods
will have it that naught of Troy should be left, and
thou be minded that thou and thine should perish
with the city, be it so. The way is easy; soon will
Pyrrhus be here; Pyrrhus, red with Priam’s blood;
Pyrrhus, who slays the son before the face of the
father, and the father at the altar. Was it for this,
kind Mother Venus, that thou broughtest me safe
through fire and sword, to see the enemy in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
home, and my father and my wife and my son lying
slaughtered together? Comrades, give me my
arms, and take me back to the battle. At the least
I will die avenged.”</p>

<p>But as he girded on his arms and would have
departed from the house, his wife Creüsa caught
his feet upon the threshold, staying him, and held
out the little Ascanius, saying, “If thou goest to
thy death, take wife and child with thee; but if thou
hopest aught from arms, guard first the house
where thou hast father and wife and child.”</p>

<p>And lo! as she spake there befell a mighty marvel,
for before the face of father and mother there
was seen to shine a light on the head of the boy
Ascanius, and to play upon his waving hair and
glitter on his temples. And when they feared to
see this thing, and would have stifled the flame or
quenched it with water, the old man Anchises in
great joy raised his eyes to heaven, and cried aloud,
“O Father Jupiter, if prayer move thee at all, give
thine aid and make this omen sure.” And even as
he spake the thunder rolled on his left hand, and a
star shot through the skies, leaving a long trail of
light behind, and passed over the house-tops till
it was hidden in the woods of Ida. Then the old
man lifted himself up and did obeisance to the star,
and said, “I delay no more: whithersoever ye lead
I will follow. Gods of my country, save my house
and my grandson! This omen is of you. And
now, my son, I refuse not to go.”</p>

<p>Then said Æneas, and as he spake the fire came
nearer and the light was clearer to see, and the
heat more fierce, “Climb, dear father, on my shoulders;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
I will bear thee, nor grow weary with the
weight. We will be saved or perish together. The
little Ascanius shall go with me, and my wife follow
behind, not over near. And ye, servants of my
house, hearken to me; ye mind how that to one who
passes out of the city there is a tomb and a temple
of Ceres in a lonely place, and an ancient cypress
tree hard by. There will we gather by divers ways.
And do thou, my father, take the holy images in
thy hands, for as for me, who have but newly come
from battle, I may not touch them till I have
washed me in the running stream.”</p>

<p>And as he spake he put a cloak of lion’s skin
upon his shoulders, and the old man sat thereon.
Ascanius also laid hold of his hand, and Creüsa followed
behind. So he went in much dread and
trembling. For, indeed, before sword and spear of
the enemy he had not feared, but now he feared for
them that were with him. But when he was come
nigh unto the gates, and the journey was well-nigh
finished, there befell a grievous mischance, for there
was heard a sound as of many feet through the
darkness; and the old man cried to him, “Fly, my
son, fly; they are coming. I see the flashing of
shields and swords.” But as Æneas hasted to go,
Creüsa his wife was severed from him. But
whether she wandered from the way or sat down
in weariness, no man may say. Only he saw her
no more, nor knew her to be lost till, all his company
being met at the temple of Ceres, she only
was found wanting. Very grievous did the thing
seem to him, nor did he cease to cry out in his
wrath against gods and men. Also he bade his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
comrades have a care of his father and his son,
and of the household gods, and girded him again
with arms, and so passed into the city. And first he
went to the wall and to the gate by which he had
come forth, and then to his house, if haply she had
returned thither. But there, indeed, the men of
Greece were come, and the fire had well-nigh mastered
it. And after that he went to the citadel and
to the palace of King Priam. And lo! in the porch
of Juno’s temple, Phœnix and Ulysses were keeping
guard over the spoil, even the treasure of the
temples, tables of the gods, and solid cups of gold,
and raiment, and a long array of them that had
been taken captive, children and women. But not
the less did he seek his wife through all the streets
of the city, yea, and called her aloud by name.
But lo! as he called, the image of her whom he
sought seemed to stand before him, only greater
than she had been while she was yet alive. And
the spirit spake, saying, “Why art thou vainly
troubled? These things have not befallen us
against the pleasure of the gods. The ruler of
Olympus willeth not that Creüsa should bear thee
company in thy journey. For thou hast a long
journey to take, and many seas to cross, till thou
come to the Hesperian shore, where Lydian Tiber
flows softly through a good land and a fertile.
There shalt thou have great prosperity, and take
to thyself a wife of royal race. Weep not then for
Creüsa, whom thou lovest, nor think that I shall be
carried away to be a bond-slave to some Grecian
woman. Such fate befits not a daughter of Dardanus
and daughter-in-law of Venus. The mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
Mother of the Gods keepeth me in this land to
serve her. And now, farewell, and love the young
Ascanius, even thy son and mine.”</p>

<p>So spake the spirit, and when Æneas wept and
would have spoken, vanished out of his sight.
Thrice he would have cast his arms about her neck,
and thrice the image mocked him, being thin as air
and fleeting as a dream. Then, the night being
now spent, he sought his comrades, and found with
much joy and wonder that a great company of men
and women were gathered together, and were willing,
all of them, to follow him whithersoever he
went.</p>

<p>And now the morning star rose over Mount Ida,
and Æneas, seeing that the Greeks held the city,
and that there was no longer any hope of succor,
went his way to the mountains, taking his father
with him.</p>

<h3 id="THE_ADVENTURE_WITH_THE">THE ADVENTURE WITH THE
HARPIES</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was the first dawn of summer, and the green
herb was already beginning to shoot among the
blackened ruins of Troy, when the little fleet, bearing
that shattered remnant of a mighty nation, put
out into the deep. Tears dimmed the eyes of
Æneas and his men as they saw their native shores
fade away into the distance behind them. The
past was all sorrow and the future was veiled in
mystery and terror; but Heaven’s eternal eye was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
watching them, and a divine hand was held over
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mountains of Crete have sunk beneath the
horizon, and nothing appears but sea and sky, now
black with clouds and lowering with impending
storm. Down comes the wind, with sheets of rain,
blotting out the view, so that the helmsmen lose
their bearings, and drive at random before the
tempest. Three days and three nights they are
thus hurled along at the mercy of the gale; and
when the weather begins to clear Æneas finds himself
under the lee of a rocky island, one of the group
called Strophades, in the Ionian Sea. One by one
his vessels come struggling in, sorely battered by
the heavy weather; and at length they all cast
anchor in a sheltered inlet, and the weary multitude
seeks repose and refreshment in the green meadows
which run down to the beach, while the more active
beat the bushes in search of game.</p>

<p>Soon the welcome sound of lowing and bleating
is heard, and a herd of fat oxen and a flock of
goats are seen feeding near at hand. The choicest
of the herd are speedily hemmed in and slaughtered,
providing the materials for a joyful feast. But
in the midst of the banquet all the air grows loud
with the sound of whirring wings, and three monstrous
creatures, with the bodies of birds and the
faces of women, swoop down from the mountains,
uttering discordant cries. The presence of these
hideous beings brings pollution to all around
them, and the very meat which the Trojans are
eating grows tainted in their mouths; for these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
are the foul Harpies, who once dwelt on the shores
of Thrace and tormented the unhappy Phineus, but
being driven away by the sons of Boreas, when the
Argonauts passed that way on their voyage, they
had taken up their abode on this lonely island.</p>

<p>Æneas and his company gave way before these
revolting assailants, and resumed their interrupted
meal in a spot sheltered by rocks and trees; but
again the Harpies came down upon them, and
turned their meat into carrion. They drew their
swords, and strove to beat off these importunate
guests; but their blows fell harmless, as if they
had struck upon mail of proof; and the Harpies
took wing again, and were seen towering, like
vultures, high in air—all but one, who alighted on
a neighboring rock, and shrieked at the discomfited
Trojans with a voice as frightful as her face.</p>

<p>“Accursed breed of an ancestor accursed, would
ye add violence to robbery, and drive the Harpies
from their home? Then hear this oracle, which
I heard from Apollo, and he from Jupiter: Your
voyage is to Italy, and to Italy shall ye come; but,
ere ever ye shall found a city there, dire hunger
shall compel you to devour your tables, in vengeance
for the wrong which ye have wrought upon
me and my sisters.”</p>

<p>With prayer and sacrifice they sought to avert
the evil foretold them; and when these were ended
they went on board their ships, and the south wind
bore them from that inhospitable shore. Then
Ithaca looms in view, the rugged nurse of cruel
Ulysses, and many a brow is bent, and many a
curse is muttered, at the mention of that hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
name. At last a cloud-capped peak appears, and,
sweeping through a rocky and perilous channel,
they cast anchor beneath the shadow of Apollo’s
temple in the bay of Actium.</p>

<p>Winter is now approaching, and for some time
their travels are at an end. The winter was passed
in rest and recreation. At the first dawn of spring
they broke up their camp, and skirting the coast
of Epirus, put into the harbor of Buthrotum, on
the mainland, opposite the blue mountains of Corfu.</p>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">Laden with rich gifts, and pursued by their
kind hosts with blessings and tears, the children
of destiny launch their ships, and at the fall of
evening anchor under the towering headland which
juts out into the Adriatic to meet the opposite
cliffs of Italy. Here they intend to pass the night
and cross the narrow waters next day. But at
midnight Palinurus, the captain of Æneas’s vessel,
wakes suddenly, and, seeing that the night is calm
and the wind fair, gives the signal to start. With
level sails they bound swiftly over the softly
heaving, starlit waters, and every heart beats
high as they draw nearer and nearer to the land
of their adoption. And now the stars grew pale,
and dawn flushed rosy red on the Acroceraunian
heights, while before them, in the west, appeared
a low line of misty hills. “Italy!” cried Achates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the trusty squire of Æneas; and all the fleet took
up the cry, till the air rang with the magic name
of Italy. Then Anchises filled a golden goblet
with wine, and, standing high on the after-deck of
the vessel, poured a drink-offering to the powers
of land and sea, praying for a prosperous voyage
and a safe landing. The wind blew stronger, in
answer to his prayer, and speedily they saw before
them an opening in the rock-bound coast, leading
by a narrow channel into a land-locked basin. On
a lofty height, commanding the haven, stood the
columned temple of Minerva, and on a meadow
near the shore four snow-white steeds were grazing.
“It is a message of war,” said Anchises; for the
horse is a warlike beast.</p>

<p>Here they may not linger, for all the coast
bristles with foes. But before they turn their
prows southward they veil their faces, as is the
fashion of the Trojans, and with bowed knee and
suppliant hands breathe the dreaded names of
Juno and Minerva.</p>

<p>The shores of Italy begin to fade, and far away,
on the southern horizon, rises the fiery crest of
Ætna. To the right they hear an angry, moaning
sound, which warns them that they are on the
threshold of the dreaded Sicilian strait, the abode
of Scylla and Charybdis. Even at this distance
the billows rise to a gigantic height, threatening
to swamp their vessels. Palinurus calls to his
men to take to their oars; the rest of the fleet
follow his example, and, borne forward by oars
and sails, they are soon out of the reach of danger.
With sunset the wind dropped, and after hours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
weary toil they landed in the darkness beneath the
black shadow of Ætna, where the giant Enceladus
lies chained on his uneasy couch. For after the
defeat of the Titans, the enormous brood of Earth,
who had risen up in revolt against Jove, Enceladus,
the most violent of these fierce rebels, was confined
in a subterranean dungeon, and the huge mass of
Ætna was flung upon his bruised limbs to keep
him fast; and whenever he stirs in that living grave
the whole mountain quakes and trembles, and fire
and smoke and molten rocks are belched up through
the throat of the furnace.</p>

<p>Fevered was the sleep and troubled the dreams
of the Trojans while their fleet lay moored in that
fearful neighborhood. The night was black and
starless, and the air was full of strange sounds,
as if some vast, primeval monster were groaning
and gasping for breath. The day dawned red and
threatening, and Æneas had given the order to
embark, when out of the woods which clothe the
lower slopes of Ætna a man came slowly limping,
whose appearance showed him to be in the last
extremity of want and misery. He was covered
with mire, and clothed in rags, scarce held together
with thorns, and his face was almost hidden by a
matted growth of hair and beard. In such guise
he came on with feeble steps, holding out his hands
like one imploring pity and protection. When he
recognized the Trojan arms and dress he halted
suddenly, and seemed to hesitate; then, summoning
resolution, he came on again with quickened
steps, and flung himself at the knees of Æneas,
who had advanced to meet him. “Save me,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
cried, speaking in the Greek language, with sobs
and tears; “only take me from this horrible
place, and then use me as ye will. I am a Greek,
as ye hear, and I fought with the other Greeks
against Troy. If that is a crime past forgiveness
let me suffer for it; tear me limb from limb, and
fling the fragments on the waves—it will be something
to be slaughtered by human hands.”</p>

<p>Touched to the heart by that speaking image
of wretchedness and despair Æneas raised the poor
outcast from the ground, comforted him with
gentle words, and encouraged him to tell his story.
Reassured by this kind reception he informed
them that he was one of the comrades of Ulysses,
left behind in their hasty flight from the cave of
the Cyclops Polyphemus. For the hardy Ithacan
had visited this island in his wanderings, and had
put out the single eye of Polyphemus, which
flamed like the sun in the center of his forehead,
in revenge for the murder of his comrades, whom
the cannibal monster had slain and devoured. For
three months the unhappy castaway had skulked
in the woods, supporting life on berries and roots,
and affrighted by the ponderous tread of Polyphemus
and his brethren, and their mighty voices,
which rumbled like thunder over his head. Then,
catching sight of the Trojan vessels, he had crept
from his hiding-place, determined to trust himself
to the mercy of the new-comers, whoever they
might be.</p>

<p>He had just finished his story when a sound of
crashing boughs was heard, as if some great beast
were advancing through the jungle; and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
moment the giant shepherd came into view, supporting
his footsteps on the trunk of a tall pine.
Slowly he felt his way towards the sea, that
monster horrible, misshapen, huge, and sightless;
and when he reached the margin of the bay he
knelt down, and washed the oozing gore from the
gaping pit in his brow, while groans, as of some
wounded leviathan, made the very waters tremble.</p>

<p>In wild panic the people of Æneas fled to their
ships, and the hollow cliffs resounded to the beat
of a thousand oars as they made haste to reach
the open sea. Polyphemus heard, and waded out
into deep water in the direction of the sound, with
arms outstretched, to seize one of the flying
vessels. But, finding himself outpaced, he lifted
up his voice, and sent forth a colossal shout, which
was bellowed back from the caverns of Ætna, and
reached the far-off shores of Italy. Roused by
that tremendous signal his brethren came rushing
from the woods, and gathered in dread conclave,
filling all the beach. Like towering oaks they
stood, or tall cypress-trees, glaring with orbs of
fire at the Trojan fleet and the dashing oars. But
the wind blew fair, and soon that tall cohort
dwindled to pigmy size in the distance, and the
rugged outlines of Ætna grew fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>Along the eastern and southern shore of Sicily
they fly, where the blue waters lap softly round
the feet of gently sloping hills, one day to be the
site of many a famous city—Syracuse and Agrigentum
and Gela. Having rounded the western
cape of the island they come to anchor in the
harbor of Drepanum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>Here a great sorrow fell upon Æneas; his aged
father, Anchises, who had followed him through
all his wanderings, and cheerfully endured many
perils and privations, passed gently away, worn
out with years and sorrows; and his bones were
laid in foreign soil, far from the land of his birth.</p>

<p>So far the Trojan emigrants have been suffered
to proceed, slowly and by winding ways, but
without any direct hindrance, towards their destined
goal. But now a new power appears on
the scene, and a hostile influence begins to work
against them, which will henceforth dog their footsteps
for many years. That power is Juno, who
had ever been Troy’s bitterest and most implacable
enemy.</p>

<p>Many causes concurred to keep alive her hatred
against that devoted race—the judgment of
Paris, who had given the prize of beauty to her
rival, Venus; the high favor shown to Ganymede,
a lovely Trojan boy, whom Jupiter had made immortal,
and exalted to be his cup-bearer; and the
ten long years of hope deferred and anxious toil
when the Greeks were fighting against Troy. Besides
all these bitter memories, a new and pressing
occasion had lately arisen to fan the smouldering
embers of her resentment into a blaze. On the
northern coast of Africa, fronting the shores of
Sicily, a colony from Tyre had recently founded
the city of Carthage, and the capricious Queen of
Heaven had centered all her affections on the
Tyrian settlement, forgetting the ancient ties which
bound her to the Grecian states. And now she
had heard a prophecy, foretelling that a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
nation was fated to spring from the blood of the
Trojan exiles which should one day level the towers
of Carthage with the dust and found a new empire
upon her ruins.</p>

<p>Seated on her heavenly car the goddess was
speeding on her way from Carthage, full of ambitious
schemes for the rising city, when, turning
her eyes earthward, she saw the fleet of Æneas
putting out from the shore of Sicily and heading
for the Italian coast. At this unwelcome sight
she checked the flight of her airy steeds, and communed
thus with her heart: “There goes the
Prince of Troy, the child of fortune, and thinks to
thwart my purpose, and bring all my plans to
naught. Powers less august than I can work their
will, and vindicate their insulted majesty; Ajax
blasphemed against Pallas, and in the midst of his
boastings was blasted by Jove’s fiery bolt—and I,
the high Queen of Heaven, the consort of heaven’s
king, must war in vain for years against this broken
remnant of a ruined race.”</p>

<h3 id="VENUS_SENDS_AENEAS_TO_QUEEN">VENUS SENDS ÆNEAS TO QUEEN
DIDO</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Not many days after Æneas and his companions
set sail. But scarce were they out
of sight of the land of Sicily when Juno had
espied them. Very wroth was she that they should
be now drawing near to the end of their journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
and she smote the ship with the thunderbolts of
Jupiter.…</p>

<p>Then Æneas and his companions, being sore
wearied with the storm, made for the nearest shore,
even Africa, where they found a haven running far
into land, into which the waves come not till their
force be spent.…</p>

<p>Now it came to pass on the next day that Æneas,
having first hidden his ships in a bay that was well
covered with trees, went forth to spy out the new
land whither he was come, and Achates only went
with him. And Æneas had in each hand a broad-pointed
spear. And as he went there met him in
the middle of the wood his mother, but habited as a
Spartan virgin, for she had hung a bow from her
shoulders after the fashion of a huntress, and her
hair was loose, and her tunic short to the knees, and
her garments gathered in a knot upon her breast.
Then first the false huntress spake, “If perchance
ye have seen one of my sisters wandering hereabouts,
make known to me the place. She is girded
with a quiver, and is clothed with the skin of a
spotted lynx, or, may be, she hunts a wild boar with
horn and hound.”</p>

<p>To whom Æneas, “I have not seen nor heard
sister of thine, O virgin—for what shall I call thee?
for, of a surety, neither is thy look as of a mortal
woman, nor yet thy voice. A goddess certainly
thou art, sister of Phœbus, or, haply, one of the
nymphs. But whosoever thou art, look favorably
upon us and help us. Tell us in what land we be,
for the winds have driven us hither, and we know
not aught of place or people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>And Venus said, “Nay, stranger I am not such
as ye think. We virgins of Tyre are wont to carry
a quiver and to wear a buskin of purple. For indeed
it is a Tyrian city that is hard by, though the
land be Libya. And of this city Dido is queen,
having come hither from Tyre, flying from the
wrong-doing of her brother. And indeed the
story of the thing is long, but I will recount the
chief matter thereof to thee. The husband of this
Dido was one Sichæus, richest among all the men
of Phœnicia, and greatly beloved of his wife. Now
the brother of this Sichæus was Pygmalion, the
king of the country, and he exceeded all men in
wickedness. And when there arose a quarrel between
them, the king, being exceedingly mad after
gold, took him unaware, even as he did sacrifice
at the altar, and slew him. And the king hid the
matter many days from Dido, and cheated her with
false hopes. But at the last there came to her in
her dreams the likeness of the dead man, baring his
wounds and showing the wickedness which had been
done. Also he bade her make haste and fly from
that land, and, that she might do this the more
easily, told her of great treasure, gold and silver,
that was hidden in the earth. And Dido, being
much moved by these things, made ready for
flight; also she sought for companions, and there
came together to her all as many as hated the king
or feared him. Then did they seize ships that
chanced to be ready and laded them with gold, even
the treasure of King Pygmalion, and so fled across
the sea. And in all this was a woman the leader.
Then came they to this place, where thou seest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
walls and citadel of Carthage, and bought so much
land as they could cover with a bull’s hide. And
now do ye answer me this, Whence come ye, and
whither do ye go?”</p>

<p>Then answered Æneas, “Should I tell the whole
story of our wanderings, and thou have leisure to
hear, evening would come ere I could make an end.
We are men of Troy, who, having journeyed over
many seas, have now been driven by storms to this
shore of Libya. And as for me, men call me Prince
Æneas. The land I seek is Italy, and my race is
from Jupiter himself. With twenty ships did I set
sail, going in the way whereof the gods sent me.
And of these scarce seven are left. And now,
seeing that Europe and Asia endure me not, I
wander over the desert places of Africa.”</p>

<p>But Venus suffered him not to speak more, but
said, “Whoever thou art, stranger, that art come to
this Tyrian city, thou art surely beloved by the
gods. And now go, show thyself to the queen. And
as for thy ships and thy companions, I tell thee
that they are safe in the haven, if I have not learnt
augury in vain. See those twenty swans, how joyously
they fly! And now there cometh an eagle
swooping down from the sky, putting them to confusion,
but now again they move in due order, and
some are settling on the earth and some are preparing
to settle. Even so doth it fare with thy
ships, for either are they already in the haven or
enter thereinto with sails full set.”</p>

<p>And as she spake she turned away, and there
shone a rosy light from her neck, also there came
from her hair a sweet savor as of ambrosia, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
her garments grew under her feet; and Æneas perceived
that she was his mother and cried aloud—</p>

<p>“O my mother, why dost thou mock me so often
with false shows, nor sufferest me to join my hand
onto thy hand, and to speak with thee face to face?”</p>

<p>And he went towards the walls of the city. But
Venus covered him and his companions with a mist,
that no man might see them, or hinder them, or inquire
of their business, and then departed to Paphos,
where was her temple and also many altars
of incense. Then the men hastened on their way,
and mounting a hill which hung over the city, marveled
to behold it, for indeed it was very great and
noble, with mighty gates and streets, and a multitude
that walked therein. For some built the
walls and the citadel, rolling great stones with their
hands, and others marked out places for houses.
Also they chose those that should give judgment
and bear rule in the city. Some, too, digged out
harbors, and others laid the foundations of a theatre,
and cut out great pillars of stone. Like to
bees they were, when, the summer being newly
come, the young swarms go forth, or when they
labor filling the cells with honey, and some receive
the burdens of those that return from the fields,
and others keep off the drones from the hive. Even
so labored the men of Tyre. And when Æneas
beheld them he cried: “Happy ye, who even now
have a city to dwell in!” And being yet hidden by
the mist, he went in at the gate and mingled with
the men, being seen of none.</p>

<p>Now, in the midst of the city was a wood, very
thick with trees, and here the men of Carthage, first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
come to the land from their voyage, had digged out
of the ground that which Juno had said should be a
sign to them, even a horse’s head; for that, finding
this, their city would be mighty in war, and full of
riches. Here, then, Dido was building a temple to
Juno, very splendid, with threshold of bronze, and
many steps thereunto; of bronze also were the doorposts
and the gates. And here befell a thing which
gave much comfort and courage to Æneas; for, as
he stood and regarded the place, waiting also for
the queen, he saw set forth in order upon the walls
the battles that had been fought at Troy, the sons of
Atreus also, and King Priam, and fierce Achilles.
Then said he, not without tears, “Is there any land,
O Achates, that is not filled with our sorrows?
Seest thou Priam? Yet withal there is a reward
for virtue here also, and tears and pity for the
troubles of men. Fear not, therefore. Surely the
fame of these things shall profit us.”</p>

<p>Then he looked, satisfying his soul with the
paintings on the walls. For there was the city of
Troy. In this part of the field the Greeks fled and
the youth of Troy pursued them, and in that the
men of Troy fled, and Achilles followed hard upon
them in his chariot. Also he saw the white tents of
Rhesus, King of Thrace, whom the fierce Diomed
slew in his sleep, when he was newly come to Troy,
and drave his horses to the camp before they ate
of the grass of the fields of Troy or drank the
waters of Xanthus. There also Troïlus was pictured,
ill-matched in battle with the great Achilles.
His horses bare him along; but he lay on his back
in the chariot, yet holding the reins, and his neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
and head were dragged upon the earth, and the
spear-point made a trail in the dust. And in another
place the women of Troy went suppliant-wise
to the temple of Minerva, bearing a great and
beautiful robe, sad and beating their breasts, and
with hair unbound; but the goddess regarded them
not. Also Achilles dragged the body of Hector
three times round the walls of Troy, and was selling
it for gold. And Æneas groaned when he saw
the man whom he loved, and the old man Priam
reaching out helpless hands. Also he knew himself,
fighting in the midst of the Grecian chiefs;
black Memnon also he knew, and the hosts of the
East; and Penthesilea leading the army of the
Amazons with shields shaped as the moon. Fierce
she was to see, with one breast bared for battle,
and a golden girdle beneath it, a damsel daring to
fight with men.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="QUEEN_DIDO_WELCOMES_AENEAS">QUEEN DIDO WELCOMES ÆNEAS</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">But while Æneas marvelled to see these things,
lo! there came, with a great throng of youths
behind her, Dido, most beautiful of women, fair as
Diana, when, on the banks of Eurotas or on the
hills of Cynthus, she leads the dance with a thousand
nymphs of the mountains about her. On her
shoulder she bears a quiver, and overtops them all,
and her mother, even Latona, silently rejoices to
behold her. So fair and seemly to see was Dido as
she bare herself right nobly in the midst, being busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
in the work of her kingdom. Then she sat herself
down on a lofty throne in the gate of the temple,
with many armed men about her. And she did
justice between man and man; also she divided the
work of the city, sharing it equally or parting it
by lot.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden Æneas heard a great clamor,
and saw a company of men come quickly to the
place, among whom were Antheus and Sergestus
and Cloanthus, and others of the men of Troy that
had been parted from him in the storm. Right
glad was he to behold them, yet was not without
fear; and though he would fain have come forth
and caught them by the hand, yet did he tarry,
waiting to hear how the men had fared, where they
had left their ships, and wherefore they were come.</p>

<p>Then Ilioneus, leave being now given that he
should speak, thus began: “O queen, whom Jupiter
permits to build a new city in these lands, we men
of Troy, whom the winds have carried over many
seas, pray thee that thou save our ships from fire,
and spare a people that serveth the gods. For,
indeed, we are not come to waste the dwellings of
this land, or to carry off spoils to our ships. For,
of a truth, they who have suffered so much think
not of such deeds. There is a land which the Greeks
call Hesperia, but the people themselves Italy,
after the name of their chief; an ancient land,
mighty in arms and fertile of corn. Hither we
were journeying, when a storm arising scattered
our ships, and only these few that thou seest escaped
to the land. And can there be nation so savage
that it receiveth not shipwrecked men on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
shore, but beareth arms against them, and forbiddeth
them to land? Nay, but if ye care not for
men, yet regard the gods, who forget neither them
that do righteously nor them that transgress. We
had a king, Æneas, than whom there lived not a
man more dutiful to gods and men, and greater in
war. If indeed he be yet alive, then we fear not at
all. For of a truth it will not repent thee to have
helped us. And if not, other friends have we, as
Acestes of Sicily. Grant us, therefore, to shelter
our ships from the wind; also to fit them with fresh
timber from the woods, and to make ready oars
for rowing, so that, finding again our king and our
companions, we may gain the land of Italy. But
if he be dead, and Ascanius his son lost also, then
there is a dwelling ready for us in the land of Sicily,
with Acestes, who is our friend.”</p>

<p>Then Dido, her eyes bent on the ground, thus
spake: “Fear not, men of Troy. If we have
seemed to deal harshly with you, pardon us, seeing
that, being newly settled in this land, we must
keep watch and ward over our coasts. But as for
the men of Troy, and their deeds in arms, who
knows them not? Think not that we in Carthage
are so dull of heart, or dwell so remote from man,
that we are ignorant of these things. Whether,
therefore, ye will journey to Italy, or rather return
to Sicily and King Acestes, know that I will give
you all help, and protect you; or, if ye will, settle
in this land of ours. Yours is this city which I am
building. I will make no difference between man
of Troy and man of Tyre. Would that your king
also were here! Surely I will send those that seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
him in all parts of Libya, lest haply he should be
gone astray in any forest or strange city of the
land.”</p>

<p>And when Æneas and Achates heard these
things they were glad, and would have come forth
from the cloud, and Achates said, “What thinkest
thou? Lo, thy comrades are safe, saving him whom
we saw with our own eyes drowned in the waves;
and all other things are according as thy mother
said.”</p>

<p>And even as he spake the cloud parted from
about them, and Æneas stood forth, very bright to
behold, with face and breast as of a god, for his
mother had given to him hair beautiful to see, and
cast about him the purple light of youth, even as
a workman sets ivory in some fair ornament, or
compasseth about silver or marble of Paros with
gold. Then spake he to the queen, “Lo! I am he
whom ye seek, even Æneas of Troy, scarcely saved
from the waters of the sea. And as for thee, O
queen, seeing that thou only hast been found to pity
the unspeakable sorrows of Troy, and biddest us,
though we be but poor exiles and lacking all things,
to share thy city and thy home, may the gods do
so to thee as thou deservest. And, of a truth, so
long as the rivers run to the seas, and the shadows
fall on the hollows of the hills, so long will thy
name and thy glory survive, whatever be the land
to which the gods shall bring me.” Then gave he
his right hand to Ilioneus, and his left hand to
Sergestus, and greeted them with great joy.</p>

<p>And Dido, hearing these things, was silent for
a while, but at the last she spake: “What ill fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
brings thee into perils so great? What power drave
thee to these savage shores? Well do I mind me
how in days gone by there came to Sidon one
Teucer, who, having been banished from his country,
sought help from Belus that he might find a
kingdom for himself. And it chanced that in
those days Belus, my father, had newly conquered
the land of Cyprus. From that day did I know the
tale of Troy, and thy name also, and the chiefs of
Greece. Also I remember that Teucer spake honorably
of the men of Troy, saying that he was
himself sprung of the old Teucrian stock. Come
ye, therefore, to my palace. I, too, have wandered
far, even as you, and so have come to this land, and
having suffered much have learnt to succor them
that suffer.”</p>

<p>So saying she led Æneas into her palace; also she
sent to his companions in the ships great store of
provisions, even twenty oxen and a hundred bristly
swine and a hundred ewe sheep with their lambs.
But in the palace a great feast was set forth,
couches covered with broidered purple, and silver
vessels without end, and cups of gold, whereon were
embossed the mighty deeds of the men of old time.</p>

<p>And in the meantime Æneas sent Achates in
haste to the ships, that he might fetch Ascanius to
the feast. Also he bade that the boy should bring
with him gifts of such things as they had saved
from the ruins of Troy, a mantle stiff with broidery
of gold and a veil bordered with yellow acanthus,
which the fair Helen had taken with her, flying
from her home; but Leda, her mother, had given
them to Helen; a scepter likewise which Ilione,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
first-born of the daughters of Priam, had carried,
and a necklace of pearls and a double crown of
jewels and gold.</p>

<p>But Venus was troubled in heart, fearing evil
to her son should the men of Tyre be treacherous,
after their wont, and Juno remember her wrath.
Wherefore, taking counsel with herself, she called
to the winged boy, even Love, that was her son,
and spake, “My son, who art all my power and
strength, who laughest at the thunders of Jupiter,
thou knowest how Juno, being exceedingly wroth
against thy brother Æneas, causeth him to wander
out of the way over all lands. This day Dido hath
him in her palace, and speaketh him fair; but I fear
me much how these things may end. Wherefore
hear thou that which I purpose. Thy brother hath
even now sent for the boy Ascanius, that he may
come to the palace, bringing with him gifts of such
things as they saved from the ruins of Troy. Him
will I cause to fall into a deep sleep, and hide in
Cythera or Idalium, and do thou for one night take
upon thee his likeness. And when Queen Dido at
the feast shall hold thee in her lap, and kiss and
embrace thee, do thou breathe by stealth thy fire
into her heart.”</p>

<p>Then did Love as his mother bade him, and put
off his wings, and took upon him the shape of
Ascanius, but on the boy Venus caused there to
fall a deep sleep, and carried him to the woods of
Idalium, and lapped him in sweet-smelling flowers.
And in his stead Love carried the gifts to the
queen. And when he was come they sat down to
the feast, the queen being in the midst under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
canopy. Æneas also and the men of Troy lay on
coverlets of purple, to whom serving-men brought
water and bread in baskets and napkins; and within
fifty handmaids were ready to replenish the store
of victuals and to fan the fire; and a hundred
others, with pages as many, loaded the tables with
dishes and drinking-cups. Many men of Tyre also
were bidden to the feast. Much they marvelled at
the gifts of Æneas, and much at the false Ascanius.
Dido also could not satisfy herself with looking on
him, nor knew what trouble he was preparing for
her in the time to come. And he, having first embraced
the father who was not his father, and clung
about his neck, addressed himself to Queen Dido,
and she ever followed him with her eyes, and sometimes
would hold him on her lap. And still he
worked upon her that she should forget the dead
Sichæus and conceive a new love in her heart.</p>

<p>But when they first paused from the feast, lo!
men set great bowls upon the table and filled them
to the brim with wine. Then did the queen call for
a great vessel of gold, with many jewels upon it,
from which Belus, and all the kings from Belus,
had drunk, and called for wine, and having filled
it she cried, “O Jupiter, whom they call the god of
hosts and guests, cause that this be a day of joy for
the men of Troy, and for them of Tyre, and that
our children remember it forever. Also Bacchus,
giver of joy, be present, and kindly Juno.” And
when she had touched the wine with her lips, she
handed the great cup to Prince Bitias, who drank
thereout a mighty draught, and the other princes
after him. Then the minstrel Iopas, whom Atlas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
himself had taught, sang to the harp, of the moon,
how she goes on her way, and of the sun, how his
light is darkened. He sang also of men, and of
the beasts of the field, whence they come; and of
the stars, Arcturus, and the Greater Bear and the
Less, and the Hyades; and of the winter sun, why
he hastens to dip himself in the ocean; and of the
winter nights, why they tarry so long. The queen
also talked much of the story of Troy, of Priam,
and of Hector, asking many things, as of the arms
of Memnon, and of the horses of Diomed, and of
Achilles, how great he was. And at last she said
to Æneas, “Tell us now thy story, how Troy was
taken, and thy wanderings over land and sea.”
And Æneas made answer, “Nay, O queen, but thou
biddest me renew a sorrow unspeakable. Yet, if
thou art minded to hear these things, hearken.”
And he told her all that had befallen him, even to
the day when his father Anchises died.</p>

<h3 id="THE_LOVE_AND_DEATH_OF">THE LOVE AND DEATH OF
QUEEN DIDO</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Much was Queen Dido moved by the story,
and much did she marvel at him that told it,
and scarce could sleep for thinking of him. And
the next day she spake to Anna, her sister, “O my
sister, I have been troubled this night with ill
dreams, and my heart is disquieted within me.
What a man is this stranger that hath come to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
shores! How noble of mien! How bold in war!
Sure I am that he is of the sons of the gods. What
fortunes have been his! Of what wars he told us!
Surely were I not steadfastly purposed that I
would not yoke me again in marriage, this were the
man to whom I might yield. Only he—for I will
tell thee the truth, my sister—only he, since the
day when Sichæus died by his brother’s hand, hath
moved my heart. But may the earth swallow me
up, or the Almighty Father strike me with lightning,
ere I stoop to such baseness. The husband
of my youth hath carried with him my love, and he
shall keep it in the grave.”</p>

<p>So she spake, with many tears. And her sister
made answer, “Why wilt thou waste thy youth in
sorrow, without child or husband? Thinkest thou
that there is care or remembrance of such things in
the grave? No suitors, indeed, have pleased thee
here or in Tyre, but wilt thou also contend with a
love that is after thine own heart? Think too of
the nations among whom thou dwellest, how fierce
they are, and of thy brother at Tyre, what he
threatens against thee. Surely it was by the will
of the gods, and of Juno chiefly, that the ships of
Troy came hither. And this city, which thou buildest,
to what greatness will it grow if only thou wilt
make for thyself such alliance! How great will be
the glory of Carthage if the strength of Troy be
joined unto her! Only do thou pray to the gods
and offer sacrifices; and, for the present, seeing
that the time of sailing is now past, make excuse
that these strangers tarry with thee a while.”</p>

<p>Thus did Anna comfort her sister and encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
her. And first the two offered sacrifice to the gods,
chiefly to Juno, who careth for the bond of marriage.</p>

<p>Also, examining the entrails of slain beasts,
they sought to learn the things that should happen
thereafter. And ever Dido would company with
Æneas, leading him about the walls of the city
which she builded. And often she would begin to
speak and stay in the midst of her words. And
when even was come, she would hear again and
again at the banquet the tale of Troy, and while
others slept would watch, and while he was far
away would seem to see him and to hear him. Ascanius,
too, she would embrace for love of his
father, if so she might cheat her own heart. But
the work of the city was stayed meanwhile; nor did
the towers rise in their places, nor the youth practice
themselves in arms.</p>

<p>Then Juno, seeing how it fared with the queen,
spake to Venus, “Are ye satisfied with your victory,
thou and thy son, that ye have vanquished the two
of you one woman? Well I knew that thou fearedst
lest this Carthage should harm thy favorite. But
why should there be war between us? Thou hast
what thou seekedst. Let us make alliance. Let
Dido obey a Phrygian husband, and bring the men
of Tyre as her dowry.”</p>

<p>But Venus knew that she spake with ill intent, to
the end that the men of Troy should not reign in the
land of Italy. Nevertheless she dissembled with
her tongue, and spake, “Who would not rather
have peace with thee than war? Only I doubt
whether this thing shall be to the pleasure of Jupiter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
This thou must learn, seeing that thou art his
wife, and where thou leadest I will follow.”</p>

<p>So the two, taking counsel together, ordered
things in this wise. The next day a great hunting
was prepared. For as soon as ever the sun was
risen upon the earth, the youth of the city assembled
with nets and hunting spears and dogs that
ran by scent. And the princes of Carthage waited
for the queen at the palace door, where her horse
stood champing the bit, with trappings of purple
and gold. And after a while she came forth, with
many following her. And she had upon her a Sidonian
mantle, with a border wrought with divers
colors; of gold was her quiver, and of gold the knot
of her hair, and of gold the clasp to her mantle.
Æneas likewise came forth, beautiful as is Apollo
when he leaveth Lydia and the stream of Xanthus,
coming to Delos, and hath about his hair a wreath
of bay-leaves and a circlet of gold. So fair was
Æneas to see. And when the hunters came to the
hills they found great store of goats and stags,
which they chased. And of all the company Ascanius
was the foremost, thinking scorn of such hunting,
and wishing that a wild boar or a lion out of
the hills should come forth to be his prey.</p>

<p>And now befell a great storm, with much
thunder and hail, from which the hunters sought
shelter.</p>

<p>But Æneas and the queen, being left of all
their company, came together to the same cave.
And there they plighted their troth one to another.
Nor did the queen after that make secret of her
love, but called Æneas her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>Straightway went Rumor and told these things
through the cities of Libya. Now Rumor, men say,
is the youngest daughter of Earth, a marvellous
creature, moving very swiftly with feet and wings,
and having many feathers upon her, and under
every feather an eye and a tongue and a mouth and
an ear. In the night she flieth between heaven and
earth, and sleepeth not; and in the day she sitteth
on some housetop or lofty tower, or spreadeth fear
over mighty cities; and she loveth that which is
false even as she loveth that which is true. So now
she went telling through Libya how Æneas of Troy
was come, and Dido was wedded to him, and how
they lived careless and at ease, and thinking not of
the work to which they were called.</p>

<p>And first of all she went to Prince Iarbas, who
himself had sought Dido in marriage. And Iarbas
was very wroth when he heard it, and, coming to
the temple of Jupiter, spread his grief before the
god, how that he had given a place on his coasts to
this Dido, and would have taken her to wife, but
that she had married a stranger from Phrygia, another
Paris, whose dress and adornments were of
a woman rather than of a man.</p>

<p>And Jupiter saw that this was so, and he said to
Mercury, who was his messenger, “Go speak to
Æneas these words: ‘Thus saith the King of Gods
and Men. Is this what thy mother promised of
thee, twice saving thee from the spear of the
Greeks? Art thou he that shall rule Italy and its
mighty men of war, and spread thy dominion to the
ends of the world? If thou thyself forgettest these
things, dost thou grudge to thy son the citadels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Rome? What doest thou here? Why, lookest thou
not to Italy? Depart and tarry not.’”</p>

<p>Then Mercury fitted the winged sandals to his
feet, and took the wand with which he driveth the
spirits of the dead, and came right soon to Mount
Atlas, which standeth bearing the heaven on his
head, and having always clouds about his top, and
snow upon his shoulders, and a beard that is stiff
with ice. There Mercury stood a while; then, as a
bird which seeks its prey in the sea, shot headlong
down, and came to Æneas where he stood with a
yellow jasper in his sword-hilt, and a cloak of
purple shot with gold about his shoulders, and
spake: “Buildest thou Carthage, forgetting thine
own work? The Almighty Father saith to thee,
‘What meanest thou? Why tarriest thou here? If
thou carest not for thyself, yet think of thy son,
and that the Fates have given to him Italy and
Rome.’”</p>

<p>And Æneas saw him no more. And he stood
stricken with fear and doubt. Fain would he obey
the voice, and go as the gods commanded. But
how should he tell this purpose to the queen? But
at the last it seemed good to him to call certain of
the chiefs, as Mnestheus, and Sergestus, and Antheus,
and bid them make ready the ships in silence,
and gather together the people, but dissemble
the cause, and he himself would watch a fitting
time to speak and unfold the matter to the queen.</p>

<p>Yet was not Dido deceived, for love is keen of
sight. Rumor also told her that they made ready
the ships for sailing. Then, flying through the city,
even as one on whom has come the frenzy of Bacchus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
flies by night over Mount Cithæron, she came
upon Æneas, and spake: “Thoughtest thou to hide
thy crime, and to depart in silence from this land?
Carest thou not for her whom thou leavest to die?
And hast thou no fear of winter storms that vex the
sea? By all that I have done for thee and given
thee, if there be yet any place for repentance, repent
thee of this purpose. For thy sake I suffer
the wrath of the princes of Libya and of my own
people; and if thou leavest me, for what should I
live?—till my brother overthrow my city, or Iarbas
carry me away captive? If but I had a little
Æneas to play in my halls, I should not seem so
altogether desolate.”</p>

<p>But Æneas, fearing the words of Jupiter, stood
with eyes that relented not. At the last he spake:
“I deny not, O queen, the benefits that thou hast
done unto me, nor ever, while I live, shall I forget
Dido. I sought not to fly by stealth; yet did I
never promise that I would abide in this place.
Could I have chosen according to my will I had
built again the city of Troy where it stood; but the
gods command that I should seek Italy. Thou hast
thy Carthage; why dost thou grudge Italy to us?
Nor may I tarry. Night after night have I seen
my father Anchises warning me in dreams. Also
even now the messenger of Jupiter came to me—with
these ears I heard him—and bade me depart.”</p>

<p>Then, in great wrath, with eyes askance, did
Dido break forth upon him: “Surely no goddess
was thy mother, nor art thou come of the race of
Dardanus. The rocks of Caucasus brought thee
forth, and an Hyrcanian tigress fed thee. For why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
should I dissemble? Was he moved at all my tears?
Did he pity my love? Nay, the very gods are
against me. This man I took to myself when he
was shipwrecked and ready to perish. I brought
back his ships, his companions from destruction.
And now, forsooth, comes the messenger of Jupiter
with dreadful commands from the gods. As for
thee, I keep thee not. Go, seek thy Italy across
the seas: only, if there is any vengeance in heaven,
thou wilt pay the penalty for this wrong, being
wrecked on some rock in their midst. Then wilt
thou call on Dido in vain. Aye, and wherever thou
shalt go I will haunt thee, and rejoice in the dwellings
below to hear thy doom.”</p>

<p>Then she turned, and hastened to go into the
house. But her spirit left her, so that her maidens
bare her to her chamber and laid her on her bed.</p>

<p>Then Æneas, though indeed he was much
troubled in heart, and would fain have comforted
the queen, was obedient to the heavenly word, and
departed to his ships. And the men of Troy busied
themselves in making them ready for the voyage.
Even as the ants spoil a great heap of corn and
store it in their dwellings against winter, moving
in a black line across the field, and some carry the
great grains, and some chide those that linger, even
so did the Trojans swarm along the ways and labor
at the work.</p>

<p>But when Dido saw it she called to Anna her
sister, and said, “Seest thou how they hasten the
work along the shore? Even now the sails are
ready for the winds, and the sailors have wreathed
the ships with garlands, as if for departure. Go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
thou—the deceiver always trusted thee, and thou
knowest how best to move him—go and entreat
him. I harmed not him nor his people; let him then
grant me this only. Let him wait for a fairer time
for his journey. I ask not that he give up his purpose;
only that he grant me a short breathing space,
till I may learn how to bear this sorrow.”</p>

<p>And Anna hearkened to her sister, and took the
message to Æneas, yet profited nothing, for the
gods shut his ears that he should not hear. Even
as an oak stands firm when the north wind would
root it up from the earth—its leaves are scattered
all round, yet doth it remain firm, for its roots go
down to the regions below, even as far as its
branches reach to heaven—so stood Æneas firm,
and, though he wept many tears, changed not his
purpose.</p>

<p>Then did Dido grow weary of her life. For
when she did sacrifice, the pure water would grow
black, and the wine be changed into blood. Also
from the shrine of her husband, which was in the
midst of her palace, was heard a voice calling her,
and the owl cried aloud from the housetop. And
in her dreams the cruel Æneas seemed to drive her
before him; or she seemed to be going a long way
with none to bear her company, and be seeking her
own people in a land that was desert. Therefore,
hiding the thing that was in her heart, she spake to
her sister, saying, “I have found a way, my sister,
that shall bring him back to me, or set me free from
him. Near the shore of the great sea, where the
Æthiopians dwell, is a priestess, who guards the
temple of the daughters of Hesperus, being wont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
to feed the dragons that kept the apples of gold.
She is able by her charms to loose the heart from
care or to bind it, and to stay rivers also, and to
turn the courses of the stars, and to call up the
spirits of the dead. Do thou, therefore—for this
is what the priestess commands—build a pile in the
open court, and put thereon the sword which he
left hanging in our chamber, and the garments he
wore, and the couch on which he lay, even all that
was his, so that they may perish together.”</p>

<p>And when these things were done—for Anna
knew not of her purpose—and also an image of
Æneas was laid upon the pile, the priestess, with
her hair unbound, called upon all the gods that
dwell below, sprinkling thereon water that was
drawn, she said, from the lake of Avernus, and
scattering evil herbs, that had been cut at the full
moon with a sickle of bronze. Dido also, with one
foot bare and her garments loosened, threw meal
upon the fire and called upon the gods, if haply
there be any, that look upon those that love and
suffer wrong.</p>

<p>And now it was morning, and Queen Dido, from
her watch-tower, saw the ships upon the sea. Then
she smote upon her breast and tore her hair, and
cried: “Shall this stranger mock us thus? Hasten
to follow him. Bring down the ships from the
docks, make ready sword and fire. And this was the
man who bare upon his shoulders his aged father!
Why did I not tear him to pieces, and slay his companions
with the sword, and serve up the young
Ascanius at his meal? And if I had perished, what
then? for I die to-day. O Sun, that regardest all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
the earth, and Juno, that carest for marriage bonds,
and Hecate, Queen of the Dead, and ye Furies that
take vengeance on evil doers, hear me! If it be
ordered that he reach this land, yet grant that he
suffer many things from his enemies, and be driven
from his city, and beg for help from strangers, and
see his people cruelly slain with the sword; and,
when he shall have made peace on ill conditions,
that he enjoy not long his kingdom, but die before
his day, and lie unburied on the plain. And ye, men
of Tyre, hate his children and his people forever.
Let there be no love or peace between you. And
may some avenger arise from my grave who shall
persecute the race of Dardanus with fire and sword.
So shall there be war forever between him and me.”</p>

<p>Then she spake to old Barcé, who had been nurse
to her husband Sichæus: “Bid my sister bathe herself
in water, and bring with her beasts for sacrifice.
And do thou also put a garland about thy head, for
I am minded to finish this sacrifice which I have
begun, and to burn the image of the man of Troy.”</p>

<p>And when the old woman made haste to do her
bidding, Queen Dido ran to the court where the pile
was made for the burning, and mounted on the pile,
and drew the sword of Æneas from the scabbard.
Then did she throw herself upon the bed, and cry:
“Now do I yield up my life. I have finished my
course. I have built a mighty city. I have avenged
my husband on him that slew him. Happy had I
been—yea, too happy! had the ships of Troy never
come to this land.” Then she kissed the bed and
cried: “Shall I die unavenged? Nevertheless let me
die. The man of Troy shall see this fire from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
sea whereon he journeys, and carry with him an
augury of death.”</p>

<p>And when her maidens looked, lo! she had fallen
upon the sword, and the blood was upon her hands.
And a great cry went up through the palace, exceeding
loud and bitter, even as if the enemy had
taken Carthage or ancient Tyre, and the fire were
mounting over the dwellings of men and of gods.
And Anna, her sister, heard it, and rushing through
the midst called her by name: “O my sister, was
this thy purpose? Were the pile and the sword and
the fire for this? Why wouldst thou not suffer that
I should die with thee? For surely, my sister, thou
hast slain thyself, and me, and thy people, and thy
city. But give me water, ye maidens, that I may
wash her wounds, and if there be any breath left in
her, we may yet stay it.”</p>

<p>Then she climbed on to the pile, and caught her
sister in her arms, and sought to staunch the blood
with her garments. Three times did Dido strive to
raise her eyes; three times did her spirit leave her.
Three times she would have raised herself upon her
elbow; three times she fell back upon the bed, looking
with wandering eyes for the light, and groaning
that she yet beheld it.</p>

<p>Then Juno, looking down from heaven, saw that
her pain was long, and pitied her, and sent down
Iris her messenger, that she might loose the soul
that struggled to be free. For, seeing that she died,
not by nature, nor yet by the hand of man, but
before her time, and of her own madness, Queen
Proserpine had not shred the ringlet from her head
which she shreds from them that die. Wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Iris, flying down with dewy wings from heaven,
with a thousand colors about her from the light of
the sun, stood above her head and said: “I give thee
to death, even as I am bidden, and loose thee from
thy body.” Then she shred the lock, and Queen
Dido gave up the ghost.</p>

<h3 id="THE_RACE_OF_THE_FOUR_GALLEYS">THE RACE OF THE FOUR GALLEYS</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">On the night when Dido was keeping her last
sorrowful vigil Æneas lay sleeping on the
deck of his galley, having made all things ready for
a start next day. But in his dreams he saw the
youthful form of Mercury standing by him, perfect
in grace and beauty, and heard these warning
words: “Canst thou sleep, Æneas, on the very
brink of peril? Away, fly from this coast, before
thy path is beset with sword and brand. A woman’s
heart is a fickle and slippery thing.”</p>

<p>Æneas started from his couch in affright, and
cried to his men: “Up, comrades; take your oars,
and let us be gone. A second time I have heard the
voice of a god, and again the word is <em>Fly!</em>” And,
drawing his sword, he cut the rope which moored
his vessel to the shore. Swiftly the benches were
manned, the calm waters eddied and roared under
their sturdy strokes, and the whole fleet, urged by
one impulse, swept out to sea.</p>

<p>The wind blew fair, and the towers of Carthage
were already sinking beneath the horizon, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
a great column of smoke shot up from the direction
of Carthage, checkered by tongues of fire. It was
the funeral pyre on which Dido’s body was burning;
but the Trojans knew not this, and thinking that
perhaps it was a signal to summon the Tyrian fleet
for pursuit they redoubled their efforts, until the
smoke column dwindled to a speck, and vanished,
and nothing remained in view but sea and sky.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the wind had shifted to the north, the
sky became overcast, and the waves grew black and
threatening. Palinurus, the captain of the royal
vessel, after anxiously scrutinizing the signs of the
weather, came to Æneas, and said: “My lord, if
Jupiter himself were my warrant, I could not hope
to reach Italy in this wind. Everything forebodes
a storm, and my counsel is that we run for shelter
to the friendly harbor of Eryx, on the north coast of
Sicily, where we are sure of a brotherly welcome. It
is close at hand, unless my seamanship is at fault.”</p>

<p>Æneas was well disposed on all accounts to take
the advice of his pilot; for Eryx was a Trojan settlement,
which they had already visited on their voyage
from Epirus; and here too his father Anchises
had found his last resting place. Accordingly the
order was given, and, running before the wind,
they soon reached the shelter of the high cliffs which
guarded the harbor of Eryx.</p>

<p>As they approached the shore they saw a stalwart
warrior standing ready to receive them, grimly attired
in a bearskin, and bristling with weapons. “It
is my old friend Acestes,” said Æneas, with a smile,
“whose heart is as kind as his aspect is threatening.”
True to this description of his character, Acestes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
hails his wandering countrymen with a hearty greeting,
and entertains them with princely hospitality.</p>

<p>Next day was the anniversary of the death of
Anchises, which was celebrated by Æneas and his
men with splendid pomp, and offerings of blood and
wine and milk at the tomb. When all rites had been
duly paid Æneas made proclamation of a great
series of games, to be held on the ninth day following,
and invited all the subjects of Acestes to take
part with the Trojans in the friendly contest.</p>

<p>On the day appointed a vast multitude assembled,
and took their station on the cliffs to witness
the first event, in which four of the Trojan galleys
were to race to a rocky island, some distance from
the shore, and back again to the mainland. The
crews of the vessels—the <i>Pristis</i>, the <i>Chimæra</i>, the
<i>Centaur</i>, and the <i>Scylla</i>—were mustered in their
places; and the captains, brave in their purple uniforms,
stood conspicuous on the after-decks, glancing
critically at their brawny crews, who sat,
stripped to the waist, grasping their oars, and waiting
for the signal.</p>

<p>There was a breathless pause, then a loud blast
from a trumpet rang out for the start, and the four
galleys darted out with level prows for the open
sea, while a tremendous roar went up from the host
of spectators who thronged the cliffs. “She leads—the
<i>Chimæra</i> has the lead!” is the cry; and, in
fact, the <i>Chimæra</i>, under her captain, Gyas, is forging
ahead. She is a galley of the largest size, and
built for speed. Next comes the <i>Scylla</i>, with her crew
rowing powerfully and splendidly together; but she
is broad in the beam, and a slow traveller. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
third place is keenly contested between the <i>Pristis</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and the <i>Centaur</i>, whose figureheads may be seen
alternately passing and repassing each other, and
then again racing neck and neck.</p>

<p>The rocky island draws nearer and nearer, and
they can see the green bough of ilex, placed there
by order of Æneas, waving in the wind. The <i>Chimæra</i>
is still leading, and Gyas, her captain, calls
to his helmsman. “Keep closer,” he orders; “you
are steering too wide; let the oars graze the rocks
on the port side.” But the cautious old seaman
shakes his head, and steers in a wide curve, fearing
the shoal water near the island. Close behind looms
the tall prow of the <i>Scylla</i>, and they can hear the
water hissing and foaming round her cutwater.
“They are gaining!” shouts Gyas; and even as he
speaks the huge galley, steered by a bold and skilful
hand, takes the inside place, sweeps round the
island, and gaining deep water, rushes triumphantly
forward, bound for the shore. This was too much
for the excitable Gyas; with tears of rage and grief
he sprang upon the helmsman, and, snatching the
tiller from his hand, with one vigorous thrust he
flung the too cautious veteran into the sea. Presently
a gray head emerged from the water, and the
old man was seen swimming slowly towards the
rocks, which he reached not without difficulty, and
sat down with dripping garments and rueful countenance,
gasping, and spitting out the brine.
“Now give way, my men,” cried Gyas, putting the
helm hard down, as so to bring the galley round to
the very edge of the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Mnestheus in the <i>Pristis</i>, and Sergestus
in the <i>Centaur</i>, were still rowing a keen race,
and as they neared the turning point the <i>Centaur</i>
was leading by half a length. Seeing the wild steering
of the <i>Chimæra</i>, which was yawing and losing
way under the unskilful hand of Gyas, Mnestheus
strode up and down the gangway, calling loudly to
his crew: “Now show your mettle, my braves! Ye
who have fought at Hector’s side, and defied a thousand
perils on land and sea, save your captain from
the dishonor of coming in last.” His men respond
gallantly to the call; the huge hull of the <i>Pristis</i>
trembles under their mighty strokes, and the white
wake boils and foams behind them. And as they
strain and tug at their ponderous oars, with parched
throats and heaving chests, suddenly a loud crash
announces that fortune has come to their aid; for
the <i>Centaur</i>, taking the curve too short, has stuck
fast on a projecting ridge, and hangs, with shattered
prow and broken oars, on the rocks. While
the crew are busy with long poles, trying to get her
off, the rival <i>Pristis</i> sweeps triumphantly past her,
clears the dangerous shallows, and enters deep
water again, homeward bound. And first she
passes the <i>Chimæra</i>, who has lost her helmsman,
and cannot keep a straight course; then hard after
the <i>Scylla</i> she flies, and seems gaining on her with
every stroke.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer creeps the <i>Pristis</i>; louder and
louder grow the shouts of the waiting multitude on
the shore, whose feelings have been wound up to the
wildest excitement by the sudden changes of fortune
and the startling incidents of this memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
race. Already the prow of the <i>Pristis</i> is overlapping
the stern of the <i>Scylla</i>, when a sudden fury
seems to enter into the crew of the leading vessel,
and, as if thrust forward from below by a giant’s
hand, she makes a great bound in advance of her
pursuer, and gains the harbor.</p>

<p>The race was over, and the victorious captains,
crowned with laurel, were flaunting their honors
proudly before their admiring comrades. Cloanthus,
the captain of the <i>Scylla</i>, received as first prize
a rich mantle, with a double waving border of
Tyrian purple, on which was embroidered the story
of the rape of Ganymede—a living picture, showing
the lovely boy, seized in the midst of his woodland
sports, and borne skyward in the talons of a
gigantic eagle; while below him were seen his dogs,
leaping and baying in wild excitement, and a group
of aged attendants, with hands uplifted, and lips
parted in speechless dismay.</p>

<p>A hundred eyes were curiously scanning this rare
device when a loud laugh from the crowd on the
shore announced the return of the unlucky <i>Centaur</i>.
Like a wounded snake, crushed by the wheel of a
passing wagon, she came crawling slowly through
the harbor mouth, and landed her crestfallen crew,
among whom was Menœtes, the <i>Chimæra’s</i> helmsman,
still damp from his involuntary bath.</p>

<h3 id="THE_FOOT_RACE">THE FOOT RACE</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">Æneas now led the way to a level, grassy
plain, surrounded by hills, and displayed the
prizes for the next event, which was the foot race.
Every competitor was to receive two arrows, the
choice workmanship of Cretan armorers, and a
battle-axe chased with silver; and besides these
three special prizes were offered—a war horse,
splendidly caparisoned, for the first; a quiver of
Thracian arrows, with a rich baldric of gold work
fastened by a jewelled buckle, for the second; and
for the third a helmet won in battle from the Greeks.</p>

<p>Quite a crowd of runners assembled at the starting-place;
and conspicuous among them was seen
Euryalus, a boy of great beauty, and Nisus, his
friend, who loved him as a father. The long line
was brought level, the signal was given, and away
they went, Nisus taking the lead, followed at a
long interval by Salius, a youth of Greek descent;
Euryalus, again at some distance, held the third
place; and after him came Helymus, a Sicilian,
hotly pursued by Diores, a Trojan of the royal race
of Priam.</p>

<p>Nisus, still keeping the lead, was already within
sight of the goal, when he unwarily trod on a
muddy place, wet with the blood of oxen which
had been offered in the late sacrifice. He stumbled,
reeled, recovered himself, and then fell headlong
in the mire. But even at that moment he did
not forget his friend Euryalus, but, staggering to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
his feet, flung himself in the way of Salius as he
came up, and both rolled together on the ground.
The field was thus left open for Euryalus, who
flew past the winning-post an easy victor, amidst
a thunder of applause, for his youth and beauty
had won all hearts. Helymus came in second, and
Diores third.</p>

<p>Æneas was engaged in bestowing the prizes on
the three winners, as the custom was, at the conclusion
of the race, when Salius came up, and began
to stun the ears of the judges with his complaints.
“The first prize is mine,” he protested,
laying his hand on the bridle of the horse, in spite
of the tearful remonstrances of Euryalus and the
loud clamor of Diores, who saw himself threatened
with the loss of his prize. The dispute was stopped
by the authority of Æneas, and the ruffled Salius
was soothed by the gift of a magnificent lion-skin
with gilded claws. Hereupon Nisus came limping
up, daubed from head to foot with mud. “If you
pity the fallen,” said he to Æneas, “what am I to
have as a consolation prize?” Æneas smiled
graciously at the rueful figure of Nisus, and presented
him with a shield, richly chased by a Grecian
artist; and thus both winners and losers were sent
away happy and satisfied.</p>

<h3 id="THE_BOXING_MATCH">THE BOXING MATCH</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">A young bull, with gilded horns, and a fine
sword and helmet, were next displayed, as
prizes for the boxing match. This was a terrible
and murderous struggle, fraught with peril to life
and limb; for the boxers fought with their hands
encased in gloves of hard leather, often weighted
with iron and lead, called the <i lang="la">cæstus</i>. One champion
alone appeared ready to bear his part in this
heroic sport; he was a Trojan named Dares, and
the son of the famous boxer Amycus, who had been
killed by Pollux during the voyage of the Argonauts.
The fame of Dares was well known among
his comrades, and no one seemed inclined to dispute
his supremacy in the ring. Accordingly Dares, who
had been showing off his muscle before the crowd,
and dealing tremendous buffets to an imaginary
antagonist, strutted up to Æneas, and, laying his
hand on the bull, claimed him as his lawful prize.</p>

<p>But he was not to be allowed to triumph so easily.
Among the spectators there stood a man already
advanced in years, but of gigantic stature and massive
build. Acestes, who was standing near him,
now addressed him in terms of reproach: “Entellus,
wilt thou suffer this braggart to carry off the prize
without a blow? Hast thou forgotten thy divine
master, Eryx? Or fearest thou the face of this
blustering bully?” “I fear no man,” answered
Entellus; “but I am old, and my joints are stiff,
while that fellow is young and lusty. The greedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
knave, he cares for nothing but the prize! What
do you think of these?” he cried, stepping into the
ring, and flinging down a ponderous pair of <i lang="la">cæstus</i>
of tough bull’s hide, stiffened with lead and iron.
Dares recoiled at the sight of these frightful
weapons, and refused to face an opponent armed
in such fashion. “What would you have thought
if you had seen the gauntlets with which Hercules
fought?” asked Entellus, turning to Æneas, who
had picked up the formidable gloves, and was examining
them with amazement. “These which you
see were worn by your brother Eryx when he stood
up against Hercules. But I will take no advantage;
lend me another pair, and we will fight with
equal weapons.”</p>

<p>The change was made, Entellus stripped, and
took up his station in the middle of the arena confronting
Dares, who, powerful as he was, looked
a mere stripling as he faced the athletic veteran.
Then the boxers raised themselves to their full
height, with heads drawn back, and the battle began.
Dares was far superior in speed and agility,
while Entellus, who could have crushed him in
his arms, was slow on his feet, and short of wind.
There was a rapid interchange of blows, and the air
rang with the clatter of the hard gauntlets, as Dares
manœuvred nimbly round his huge antagonist, who
stood rooted like an oak in his place, parrying the
blows. Suddenly Entellus saw an opening, and
put in a heavy stroke, with all the force of his ponderous
right arm. Dares stepped lightly aside, and
Entellus, carried forward by the impetus of his own
blow, lost his balance, and came down with a sounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
thud on the turf. A shout of mingled triumph
and dismay greeted the fall of the Sicilian champion,
and his friends rushed forward to help him to
his feet.</p>

<p>But, neither dulled nor dismayed by his fall, that
mighty man returns keener to the battle, and
kindles strength with rage. All the vigor of his
youth comes back to him, and he chases Dares headlong
round and round the ring, now with his right
hand raining blows, now with his giant left. No
rest, no pause; like hailstones rattling on the roof,
so shower the strokes of those iron hands on the
head of the hapless Dares. At last Æneas interposed,
and stopped the unequal combat. Dares
was borne, shattered and fainting, from the ring,
and Entellus, crowned with the victor’s wreath,
took possession of the bull. “Now mark,” he said,
“Æneas, and learn, ye Trojans, what force was in
this arm in the days of my prime, and what death
Dares has escaped.” Saying this, he planted himself
firmly in front of the bull, and slowly drawing
back his gauntleted fist poised it like a club, and
dashed it with all his force between the horns of
the beast. The skull was splintered as if by a
sledge-hammer, and prostrate, lifeless, quivering,
on earth lay the bull. “That was the blow which
I designed for Dares,” said the giant, “but the bull
is a worthier sacrifice to the shade of my master
Eryx. I have fought my last round, and now I
will hang up my gauntlets in his shrine.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_CONTEST_OF_THE_ARCHERS">THE CONTEST OF THE ARCHERS</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Now, gallant archers, try your skill,” said
Æneas, pointing to a tall mast, which had
been set up in the middle of the plain, with a dove
fluttering above it fastened by the leg with a slender
cord. Lots were drawn to determine the order
of shooting, and the archers, among whom were
Mnestheus, winner of the third prize in the boat
race, Eurytion, brother of the famous Pandarus,
and the aged Acestes, took up their stations. The
first arrow struck the mast. Then Mnestheus, who
had drawn the second place, took steady aim, but,
missing the bird, chanced to sever the cord which
bound her to the mast; up flew the dove, and remained
hovering in the air above their heads.
Eurytion now raised his bow high above his head,
and, calling on his brother’s name, sent an arrow
straight into the air, and brought down the bird,
just as she was preparing for a distant flight.</p>

<p>“You have left me no mark to aim at,” said
Acestes; “but see, there is vigor left still in these
old arms of mine.” And he drew his arrow to the
head, and sent an arrow whizzing towards the cloud.
Then followed a strange portent, which kept all the
prophets busy for many a day; for as they watched
the flying shaft, it burst into flames, and, shooting
across the sky with a trail of light, burnt away, and
vanished from view like a meteor in the nights of
winter. “Hail, fiery messenger of Heaven’s will!”
cried Acestes joyfully. “And hail to thee, father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
and friend!” repeated Æneas, grasping his hand.
“Thine was the best shot of all, and I will bestow
on thee a gift of honor, since by thy hand was
wrought this wonder, and Jove himself has blessed
thine archery.” And he gave him a silver goblet,
embossed with choice designs, which was a treasured
heirloom in his family.</p>

<p>The great multitude now stood hushed in expectation,
for the most brilliant event of the day was
reserved to the last. As soon as the arena was
cleared Æneas gave a sign to Epytides, the faithful
guardian and companion of the young Iulus; and
presently a murmur arose on the outskirts of the
crowd, swelling to a great shout, as a troop of
youthful horsemen rode into the arena in three
divisions. In each division were twelve boys, all
armed with javelins, all crowned with olive wreaths,
and all wearing chains of gold. At the head of
each band rode its boyish captain. First was seen
the son of Polites, named after his grandsire Priam,
mounted on a brave chestnut with white markings
on forehead and fore-hoof; then followed the second
line, led by Atys, whose name descended to a
noble Roman house—little Atys, loved in his boyhood
by the young Iulus; and last and fairest of all
came Iulus himself, riding a gallant steed of Arab
race, which he had received as a gift from the fair
hand of Dido.</p>

<p>Loud was the applause among the Trojans as
they watched that pretty pageant of childish chivalry
and traced their fathers’ likeness on the blushing
faces of the happy boys. Having ridden slowly
round the arena they drew up in a body, facing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
spot where Æneas and the Trojan nobles were
seated round their host. Then Eyptides gave the
signal with a loud crack of his whip, and, parting
again into three separate troops, they couched their
weapons, and made a mimic charge, but, avoiding
the shock at the moment of meeting, rank passed
through rank, wheeled again, and returned to the
encounter. And so they threaded all the mazes of
a warlike dance, in which attack and retreat, rally,
and hand-to-hand assault, were pictured in living
colors on the level green.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="THE_SIBYL_SPEAKS_TO_AENEAS">THE SIBYL SPEAKS TO ÆNEAS</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Æneas finally came to the land of Italy,
nigh unto Cumæ, which was the dwelling-place
of the Sibyl. The men turned the forepart
of the ships to the sea, and made them fast with
anchors. Then they leapt forth upon the shore,
and kindled a fire; and some cut wood in the forest,
or fetched water from the stream. But Æneas
went up to the great cave of the Sibyl, where, by
the inspiration of Apollo, she foretelleth things to
come.</p>

<p>Now the temple was a marvellous place to look
upon. On the doors thereof was set forth, graven
in stone, the death of Androgeos, and the men of
Attica choosing by lot seven of their children who
should be given as a ransom yearly; and, rising
from the sea upon the other side, the land of Crete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
Likewise the Labyrinth was there and its winding
ways; but Icarus they saw not, for when his father
would have wrought the manner of his death in gold
his hands failed him: twice he strove, and twice they
failed. And when Æneas would have looked further,
the priestess said, “Linger not with these
things, but slay forthwith seven bullocks from the
herd, and seven sheep duly chosen out of the flock.”
And when they came to the cave—now there are a
hundred doors, and a voice cometh forth from each—the
Sibyl cried, “It is time. Lo! the god, the
god!” And even as she spake her look was changed
and the color of her face; also her hair was loosened,
and her breast panted, and she waxed greater
than is the stature of a man. Then she cried,
“Delayest thou to pray, Æneas of Troy? delayest
thou? for the doors open not but to prayer.” Nor
said she more. Then Æneas prayed, saying, “O
Phœbus, who didst always pity the sorrows of Troy,
and didst guide the arrow of Paris that it slew
the great Achilles, I have followed thy bidding,
journeying over many lands, and now I lay hold
on this shore of Italy, which ever seemed to fly before
me. Grant thou that our ill fortune follow us
no more. And all ye gods and goddesses who
loved not Troy, be merciful to us. And thou, O
prophetess, give, if it may be, such answer as I
would hear. So will I and my people honor thee
forever. And write it not, I pray thee, upon
leaves, lest the winds carry them away, but speak
with thy voice.”</p>

<p>And for a while the prophetess strove against
the spirit; but at the last it mastered her, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
doors flew open, and she spake, saying, “The perils
of the sea thou hast escaped, but there await thee
yet worse perils upon the land. The men of Troy
shall come to the kingdom of Lavinium. Fear not
for that; yet will they fain not have come. I see
battles, and the Tiber foaming with blood, and a
new Xanthus and Simoïs, and another Achilles,
himself also goddess-born. Juno also shall be ever
against thee. And thou shalt be a suppliant to
many cities. And the cause of all these woes shall
be again a woman. Only yield not thou, but go
ever more boldly when occasion shall serve. Little
thinkest thou that thy first succor shall be from a
city of the Greeks.”</p>

<p>And when she had ended these words, Æneas
made answer: “O lady, no toil or peril shall take
me unawares; for I have thought over all things in
my heart. But one thing I ask of thee. Here is
the door of the dwellings of the dead. Fain would
I pass thereby, that I may visit my father. I carried
him on my shoulders out of the fires of Troy,
and with me he endured many things by land and
sea, more than befitted his old age. Likewise he
bade me ask this boon of thee. Do thou therefore
pity both father and son, for thou hast the power,
if only thou wilt. Did not Orpheus bring back his
wife from the dead, having his harp only? Also
Pollux goeth many times this same path, redeeming
his brother from death. And why should I tell
of Theseus and Hercules? And I also am of the
lineage of Jupiter.”</p>

<p>Then the Sibyl spake, saying, “Son of Anchises,
it is easy to go down to hell. The door is open day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
and night. But to return, and struggle to the
upper air, that is the labor. Few only have done
it, and these of the lineage of the gods and dear to
Jupiter. Yet if thou wilt attempt it, hearken unto
me. There lieth hid in the forest a bough of gold
which is sacred to the Queen of Hell. Nor may any
man go on this journey till he have plucked it, for
the queen will have it as a gift for herself. And
when the bough is plucked, there ever groweth another;
and if it be the pleasure of the gods that thou
go, it will yield to thy hand. But know that one of
thy companions lieth dead upon the shore. First
must thou bury him and after offer due sacrifice,
even black sheep. So shalt thou approach the
dwellings of the dead.”</p>

<p>Then Æneas departed from the cave, and
Achates went with him, and much they wondered
who it might be that was dead. And when they
came to the shore, lo! Misenus lay there, than whom
no man was more skilful to call men to battle with
the voice of the trumpet. Hector’s companion he
had been in old time and then followed Æneas.
And now, blowing his trumpet on the shore, he had
challenged the gods of the sea to compare with him;
wherefore a Triton caught him and plunged him
into the sea, so that he died. Then did Æneas and
his companions prepare for the burial, cutting ilex
and oak and mountain-ash from the wood. But
when Æneas beheld the forest, how vast it was, he
said, “Now, may the gods grant that in this great
forest the bough of gold discover itself.” And as
he spake, lo! two doves flew before his face, and
settled on the grass, and he knew them to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
birds of his mother, and cried saying, “Guide me
now to the bough of gold, and thou my mother help
me as before.” Then the birds flew so that he could
still see them with his eyes, and he followed after
them.</p>

<p>But when they came to the mouth of Avernus,
they sat both of them on the tree. And lo! the
bough of gold glittered among the branches and
rustled in the wind. Right gladly did Æneas break
it off, and carry it to the dwelling of the Sibyl.</p>

<p>In the meantime the men of Troy made a great
burial for Misenus on the shore, building a pile of
wood, and washing and anointing the body. Also
they laid the body on a bier, and on it the garments
which he had worn being yet alive. Then others,
with faces turned away, held a torch to the wood,
whereon also were burnt incense and offerings of
oil. And when the burning was ended they
quenched the ashes with wine. And Corynæus
gathered the bones into an urn of bronze, and purified
the people, sprinkling them with water with a
bough of an olive-tree. Then Æneas made a great
mound, and put thereon the trumpet of the man
and his bow; and the mountain is called Misenus,
after him, to this day.</p>

<p>But when the burial was ended he did as the
Sibyl had commanded. A great cavern there is,
from which cometh so evil a stench that no bird may
fly across. There they brought four black oxen,
and the priestess poured wine upon their heads and
cut hairs from between the horns. And when they
had burned these they slew the oxen, holding dishes
for the blood. And Æneas offered a black lamb to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
the Furies and a barren heifer to the Queen of
Hell, smiting them with his sword. Then they
burned the entrails with fire, pouring oil upon
them. Then did the ground give a hollow sound
beneath them, and the dogs howled, for the goddess
was at hand. And the priestess cried, “Go ye who
may not take part in this matter. And thou,
Æneas, draw thy sword from its sheath and follow.
Now hast thou need of all thy strength and courage.”
Then she plunged into the cave, and Æneas
went with her.</p>

<h3 id="THE_DWELLINGS_OF_THE_DEAD">THE DWELLINGS OF THE DEAD</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">So they went together through the land of
shadows, like unto men who walk through a
wood in a doubtful light, when the moon indeed
hath risen, but there are clouds over the sky. And
first they came to where, in front of the gates of
hell, dwell Sorrow and Remorse, and pale Disease
and Fear, and Hunger that tempteth men to sin,
and Want, and Death, and Toil, and Slumber, that
is Death’s kinsman, and deadly War; also they saw
the chambers of the Furies, and Discord, whose hair
is of snakes that drip with blood. And in this
region there is an ancient elm, in the boughs
whereof dwell all manner of dreams, and shapes of
evil monsters, as many as have been, such as were
the centaurs, half man, half horse, and Briareus
with the hundred hands, and others also. These
Æneas, when he saw them, sought to slay, rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
upon them with the sword, but his guide warned
him that they were shadows only.</p>

<p>After this they came to the river of hell, whereon
plies the boatman Charon. A long white beard
hath he and unkempt; and his eyes are fixed in a
fiery stare, and a scarf is knotted upon his shoulder,
as is a pilot’s wont. An old man he seemeth to be,
but hale and ruddy. Now there was ever rushing
to the bank a great crowd, wives and mothers, and
valiant men of war, boys and girls dead before they
were given in marriage, and young men laid on the
funeral pile before their parents’ eyes. Thick they
were as the leaves that fall to the earth at the first
frost of autumn, or as the swallows, when they
gather themselves together, making ready to fly
across the sea to the lands of the sun. And of these
Charon would take some into his boat; but others
he would forbid, and drive from the shore. This
when Æneas saw, he marvelled, and said: “O lady,
what meaneth this concourse at the river? What
seek these souls? Why be some driven from the
bank and some ferried across?”</p>

<p>And the Sibyl made answer: “This river that
thou seest is the Styx, by which the gods in heaven
swear, and fear to break their oath. Those whom
thou seest to be driven from the bank are such as
have lacked burial, but those who are ferried across
have been buried duly; for none pass this stream
till their bodies have been laid in the grave, otherwise
they wander for a hundred years, and so at
last may cross over.”</p>

<p>Much did Æneas pity their ill fortune, and the
more when he beheld Orontes and his Lycians whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
the sea had swallowed up alive before his eyes.
Here likewise there met him his pilot Palinurus, to
whom, when he knew him, for indeed he scarce
could see him in the darkness, he said: “What god
took thee from us and drowned thee in the sea?
Surely, in this one matter, Apollo hath deceived me,
saying that thou shouldst escape the sea and come
to the land of Italy.”</p>

<p>Then answered Palinurus: “Not so, great Æneas.
For indeed to the land of Italy I came. Three
nights the south wind carried me over the sea, and
on the fourth day I saw the land of Italy from the
top of a wave. And when I swam to the shore,
and was now clinging to the rocks, my garments
being heavy with water, the savage people came
upon me, and took me for a prey, and slew me.
And now the winds and waves bear me about as
they will. Wherefore I pray thee, by thy father,
and Iulus, the hope of thy house, that thou deliver
me from these woes. Go, therefore, I beseech thee,
to the haven of Velia, and cast earth upon me for
burial; or give me now thy hand, and take me with
thee across this river.”</p>

<p>Then said the priestess: “O Palinurus, what
madness is this? Wilt thou without due burial
cross the river, and look upon the awful faces of
the Furies? Think not that the Fates can be
changed by prayers. Yet hear this, and be comforted.
They that slew thee, being sore troubled
by many plagues, shall make due expiation to thee,
and build a tomb, and make offerings thereon year
by year; and the place where they slew thee shall
be called after thy name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he took comfort and departed. But when
they came near to the river, the boatman beheld
them, and cried: “Stay thou, whoever thou art, that
comest armed to this river, and tell me what thou
seekest. This is the land of Shadows, of Sleep, and
of Night. The living may not be ferried in this
boat. An evil day it was when I carried Hercules,
and Theseus, and Pirithoüs, though they were children
of the gods. For Hercules chained the watch-dog
of hell, and dragged him trembling from his
master’s seat. And Theseus and his friend sought
to carry away the queen even from the chamber of
her husband.”</p>

<p>Then the Sibyl made answer: “Be not troubled.
We come not hither with evil thoughts. Let the
watch-dog of hell make the pale ghosts afraid; let
your queen abide in her husband’s palace; we will
not harm them. Æneas of Troy cometh down to
hell that he may speak with his father. And if thou
takest no account of such piety, yet thou wilt know
this token.”</p>

<p>And she showed him the bough of gold. And
when he saw it he laid aside his anger, rejoicing to
behold, now after many years, the marvellous gift.
Then he brought near his boat to the bank, and
drave out the souls that were therein, and took
on board Æneas and the priestess. Much did it
groan with the weight, and the water poured apace
through the seams thereof. Yet did they come safe
across.</p>

<p>Then they saw Cerberus, the watch-dog, in his
cave. And to him the Sibyl gave a cake of honey
and poppy-seed, causing sleep. And this he swallowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
opening wide his three ravenous mouths,
and straightway stretched himself out asleep across
the cave.</p>

<p>After this they heard a great wailing of infants,
even the voices of such as are taken away before
they have had lot or part in life. And near to these
were such as have died by false accusation; yet lack
they not justice, for Minos trieth their cause. And
yet beyond, they that, being guiltless, have laid
hands upon themselves. Fain would they now endure
hardships, being yet alive, but may not, for
the river keeps them in with his unlovely stream as
in a prison. Not far from these are the Mourning
Fields, where dwell the souls of those that have
died of love, as Procris, whom Cephalus slew in
error, and Laodamia, who died of grief for her husband.
And among these was Dido, fresh from the
wound wherewith she slew herself. And when
Æneas saw her darkly through the shadows, even
as one who sees, or thinketh that he sees, the new
moon lately risen, he wept, and said: “O Dido, it
was truth, then, that they told me, saying that thou
hadst slain thyself with the sword. Tell me, was
I the cause of thy death? Loath was I, O queen—I
swear it by all that is most holy in heaven or hell—to
leave thy land. But the gods, at whose bidding
I come hither this day, constrained me; nor
did I think that thou wouldst take such sorrow
from my departure. But stay; depart not; for
never again may I speak to thee but this once
only.”</p>

<p>So he spake, and would fain have appeased her
wrath. But she cast her eyes to the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
her heart was hard against him, even as a rock.
And she departed into a grove that was hard by,
wherein was her first husband, Sichæus, who loved
her even as he was loved. After this they came to
the land where the heroes dwell. And there they
saw Tydeus, who died before Thebes; and Adrastus,
and also many men of Troy, as the three sons
of Antenor, and Idæus, who was the armor-bearer
of King Priam, and bare the arms and drave the
chariot yet. All these gathered about him and
would fain know wherefore he had come. But
when the hosts of Agamemnon saw his shining
arms through the darkness, they fled, as in old days
they had fled to the ships; and some would have
cried aloud, but could not, so thin are the voices
of the dead.</p>

<p>Among these he saw Deïphobus, son of Priam.
Cruelly mangled was he, for his hands had been cut
off, and his ears and his nostrils likewise. Scarce
did Æneas know him, and he himself in shame
would have hidden his wounds; but the son of
Anchises spake to him, saying: “Who hath dealt
so foully with thee, great Deïphobus? Men told
me that on the last night of Troy thou didst fall
dead on a heap of Greeks whom thou hadst slain.
Wherefore I built thee a tomb by the sea, and thrice
called aloud thy name. But thee I found not, that
I might lay thee therein.”</p>

<p>Then Deïphobus made answer: “Thou hast left
nothing undone, but hast paid me all due honor.
But my ill fate and the accursed wickedness of the
Spartan woman have destroyed me. How we spent
that last night in idle rejoicings thou knowest. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
she, while the women of Troy danced before the
gods, stood holding a torch on the citadel, as though
she were their leader, yet in truth she called therewith
the Greeks from Tenedos. But I lay overcome
with weariness in my chamber. Then did she, a
noble wife, forsooth! take all the arms out of the
house, and my trusty sword also from under my
head; and after brought thereunto Menelaus, so
hoping to do away her sin against him; and Ulysses
also, always ready with evil counsels. What need
of more? May the gods do so and more also to
them. But tell me why hast thou came hither?”</p>

<p>And it was now past noonday, and the two had
spent in talk all the allotted time. Therefore the
Sibyl spake: “Night cometh, Æneas, and we waste
the day in tears. Lo! here are two roads. This
on the right hand leadeth to the palace of Pluto
and to the Elysian plains; and that on the left to
Tartarus, the abode of the wicked.” And Deïphobus
answered: “Be not wroth, great priestess; I
depart to my own place. Do thou, my friend, go
on and prosper.”</p>

<p>But as Æneas looked round he saw a great building,
and a threefold wall about it, and round the
wall a river of fire. Great gates there were, and a
tower of brass, and the Fury Tisiphone sat as
warder. Also he heard the sounds of those that
smote upon an anvil, and the clanking of chains.
And he stood, and said: “What mean these things
that I see and hear?” Then the Sibyl made answer:
“The foot of the righteous may not pass that
threshold. But when the Queen of Hell gave me
this office she herself led me through the place and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
told me all. There sitteth Rhadamanthus, the
Cretan, and judgeth the dead. And them that he
condemned Tisiphone taketh, and the gate which
thou seest openeth to receive them. And within
is a great pit, and the depth thereof is as the height
of heaven. Herein lie the Titans, the sons of Earth,
whom Jupiter smote with the thunder; and herein
the sons of Alœus, who strove to thrust the gods
from heaven; and Salmoneus, who would have
mocked the thunder of Jupiter, riding in his chariot
through the cities of Elis, and shaking a torch, and
giving himself out to be a god. But the lightning
smote him in his pride. Also I saw Tityos, spread
over nine acres of ground, and the vulture feeding
on his heart. And over some hangs a great stone
ready to fall; and some sit at the banquet, but when
they would eat the Fury at their side forbids, and
rises and shakes her torch and thunders in their
ears. These are they who while they were yet alive
hated their brothers, or struck father or mother, or
deceived one that trusted to them, or kept their
riches for themselves nor cared for those of their
own household (a great multitude are they), or
stirred up civil strife. And of these some roll a
great stone and cease not, and some are bound to
wheels, and some sit forever crying: ‘Learn to do
righteousness and to fear the gods.’”</p>

<p>And when the priestess had finished these words
they hastened on their way. And, after a while, she
said: “Lo! here is the palace which the Cyclopes
built for Pluto and the Queen of Hell. Here must
we offer the gift of the bough of gold.” And this
being accomplished, they came to the dwellings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
the righteous. Here are green spaces, with woods
about them; and the light of their heaven is fuller
and brighter than that which men behold. Another
sun they have and other stars. Some of them contend
together in wrestling and running; and some
dance in measure, singing the while a pleasant
song; and Orpheus, clad in a long robe, makes
music, touching his harp, now with his fingers and
now with an ivory bow. Here did Æneas marvel to
see the mighty men of old, such as were Ilus, and
Dardanus, builder of Troy. Their spears stood
fixed in the earth, and their horses fed about the
plain; for they love spear and chariot and horses;
even as they loved them upon earth. And others
sat and feasted, sitting on the grass in a sweet-smelling
grove of bay, whence flows the river which
men upon the earth call the Po. Here were they
who had died for their country, and holy priests,
and poets who had uttered nothing base, and such
as had found out witty inventions, or had done great
good to men. All these had snow-white garlands on
their heads. Then spake the Sibyl to Musæus, who
stood in the midst, surpassing them all in stature:
“Tell me, happy souls, where shall we find Anchises.”
And Musæus answered: “We have no
certain dwelling place; but climb this hill, and ye
can see the whole plain below, and doubtless him
whom ye seek.”</p>

<p>Then they beheld Anchises, where he sat in a
green valley, regarding the spirits of those who
should be born in after-time of his race. And when
he beheld Æneas coming, he stretched out his hands
and cried: “Comest thou, my son? Hast thou won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
thy way hither to me? Even so I thought that it
would be, and lo! my hope hath not failed me.”</p>

<p>And Æneas made answer: “Yea, I have come a
long way to see thee, even as thy spirit bade me.
And now let me embrace thee with my arms.”</p>

<p>But when he would have embraced him it was as
if he clasped the air.</p>

<p>Then Æneas looked and beheld a river, and a
great company of souls thereby, thick as the bees
on a calm summer day in a garden of lilies. And
when he would know the meaning of the concourse,
Anchises said: “These are souls which have yet to
live again in a mortal body, and they are constrained
to drink of the water of forgetfulness.”
And Æneas said: “Nay, my father, can any desire
to take again upon them the body of death?” Then
Anchises made reply: “Listen, my son, and I will
tell thee all. There is one soul in heaven and earth
and the stars and the shining orb of the moon and
the great sun himself; from which soul also cometh
the life of man and of beast, and of the birds of the
air, and of the fishes of the sea. And this soul is of
a divine nature, but the mortal body maketh it slow
and dull. Hence come fear and desire, and grief
and joy, so that, being as it were shut in a prison,
the spirit beholdeth not any more the light that is
without. And when the mortal life is ended yet are
not men quit of all the evils of the body, seeing that
these must needs be put away in many marvellous
ways. For some are hung up to the winds, and
with some their wickedness is washed out by water,
or burnt out with fire. But a ghostly pain we all
endure. Then we that are found worthy are sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
unto Elysium and the plains of the blest. And
when, after many days, the soul is wholly pure, it
is called to the river of forgetfulness, that it may
drink thereof, and so return to the world that is
above.”</p>

<p>Then he led Æneas and the Sibyl to a hill whence
they could see the whole company, and regard their
faces as they came; and he said: “Come, and I will
show thee them that shall come after thee. That
youth who leans upon a pointless spear is Silvius,
thy youngest child, whom Lavinia shall bear to thee
in thy old age. He shall reign in Alba, and shall
be the father of kings. And many other kings are
there who shall build cities great and famous. Lo!
there is Romulus, whom Ilia shall bear to Mars.
He shall build Rome, whose empire shall reach to
the ends of the earth and its glory to the heaven.
Seest thou him with the olive crown about his head
and the white beard? That is he who shall first give
laws to Rome. And next to him is Tullus, the warrior.
And there are the Tarquins; and Brutus, who
shall set the people free, aye, and shall slay his own
sons when they would be false to their country. See
also the Decii; and Torquatus with the cruel axe;
and Camillus winning back the standards of Rome.
There standeth one who shall subdue Corinth; and
there another who shall avenge the blood of Troy
upon the race of Achilles. There, too, thou mayest
see the Scipios, thunderbolts of war, whom the
land of Africa shall fear; and there Regulus, busy
in the furrows; and there the Fabii, chiefly him,
greatest of the name, who shall save thy country
by wise delay. Such, my son, shall be thy children’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
children. Others with softer touch shall
carve the face of man in marble or mould the
bronze; some more skilfully shall plead, or map the
skies, or tell the rising of the stars. ’Tis time, man
of Rome, to subdue the world. This is thy work, to
set the rule of peace over the vanquished, to spare
the humble, and to subdue the proud.”</p>

<p>Then he spake again: “Regard him who is the
first of all the company of conquerors. He is Marcellus;
he shall save the state in the day of trouble,
and put to flight Carthaginian and Gaul.”</p>

<p>Then said Æneas, for he chanced to see by
his side a youth clad in shining armor, and very fair
to look upon, but sad, and with downcast eyes:
“Tell me, father, who is this? How noble is he!
What a company is about him! But there is a
shadow of darkness round his head.”</p>

<p>And Anchises made answer: “O my son, seek not
to know the greatest sorrow that shall befall thy
children after thee. This youth the Fates shall
only show for a brief space to man. Rome would
seem too mighty to the gods should he but live!
What mourning shall there be for him! What a
funeral shalt thou see, O river of Tiber, as thou
flowest by the new-made tomb! No youth of the
race of Troy shall promise so much as he. Alas!
for his righteousness, and truth and valor unsurpassed!
O luckless boy, if thou canst haply break
thy evil doom thou shalt be a Marcellus. Give
handfuls of lilies. I will scatter the bright flowers
and pay the idle honors to my grandson’s shade.”</p>

<p>Thus did Anchises show his son things to be, and
kindled his soul with desire of glory. Also he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
showed him what wars he must wage, and how he
should endure, or, if it might be, avoid the evils to
come.</p>

<p>There are two gates of Sleep, of horn the one, by
which true dreams go forth; of ivory the other, by
which the false. Then did Anchises send forth his
son and the Sibyl by the ivory gate. And Æneas
returned to the ships, and making sail came to the
cape which was afterwards called Caieta.</p>

<h3 id="THE_ORACLE_FORETELLS_THE">THE ORACLE FORETELLS THE
COMING OF ÆNEAS</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">While Æneas is on his way from Cumæ to
the mouth of Tiber we will take a brief
glance at the state of things in Latium, and see
what sort of reception is awaiting him there. The
King of Latium at this time was Latinus, who
drew his descent from Saturn, an ancient pastoral
deity of Italy. His daughter, and only child, Lavinia,
was betrothed to Turnus, and the match was
strongly favored by Amata, queen and wife of
Latinus, whose heart had been won by the princely
form and high ancestry of the youthful suitor. But
just before the arrival of the Trojans strange portents
had occurred, which seemed to forbid the
union of Lavinia and Turnus. In the central
courtyard of the royal palace there was an ancient
laurel-tree, found growing on the spot by Latinus
when he began to build the city, which was named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
from this circumstance Laurentum. One morning
the whole courtyard was besieged by a buzzing
swarm of bees, which settled on the laurel, and hung
in a dense cluster from its topmost bough. “A
stranger is coming,” declared the seers, “from the
same quarter whence flew the bees, and he shall hold
sway in this royal citadel.” Another time, when
Lavinia was taking part in the sacrifice which was
offered at her betrothal, the flame caught her long
hair, and in a moment she was wrapped from head
to foot in a mysterious fire, which smoked and
blazed and roared, but did her no harm. “O king,”
proclaimed the seer again, “thy daughter is destined
to high renown, but she shall bring on this people a
wide-wasting war.”</p>

<p>Alarmed by these portents Latinus went to consult
the oracle of Faunus, his father, in the sacred
grotto near the burning spring of Albunea, which
is the Delphi of Latium. Wrapped in the skins of
sheep which had been offered in sacrifice (for so the
custom was) he lay all night at the mouth of the
cavern. “In the dead vast and middle of the night”
he heard a voice which said: “Seek not in Latium a
bridegroom for thy daughter; from a distant land
there cometh one who shall mingle his blood with
thine, and out of that union a race shall arise before
which all peoples of the earth shall bow the knee.”</p>

<p>This answer of the oracle was soon noised abroad,
and caused throughout Latium a fever of expectation
at the moment when the ships of Æneas were
first sighted off the coast.</p>

<h3 id="AENEAS_AND_HIS_COMPANIONS_EAT">ÆNEAS AND HIS COMPANIONS EAT
THEIR TABLES</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">The distant crests of the Apennines are tipped
with crimson light; every wind is hushed to
rest, and land and sea lie sleeping in the hallowed
stillness of the dawn. But hark! the silence is
broken by the measured beat of a thousand oars,
and into the mouth of Tiber sweeps the Trojan
fleet. As if they had been waiting for that signal, a
multitude of birds at the same moment burst into
song, and all the woods by the river-side ring with
melody. Æneas is the first to leap ashore; and soon
all his fleet lies moored on the yellow sand.</p>

<p>Under the spreading boughs of an ancient oak sat
Æneas with the young Iulus and those next to him
in rank. Before them was spread a rustic feast of
fruits plucked from the neighboring trees; and flat
cakes, hastily prepared with meal and eggs and
cheese, served them for dishes. When all their fruit
was consumed they finished their meal by devouring
the flat squares of cake. “Behold, we are eating
our tables!” cried Iulus, laughing; and before he
could add another word Æneas laid a warning
finger on his lips. “No more, my child,” he said.
“Thy words have a deeper meaning than thou
deemest. Long ago I heard an oracle from my
father, foretelling that in the place where hunger
compelled us to devour our tables we should find
a settled home and an abiding city. Here, then, our
wanderings are at an end.” And thus the prophecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
of Celæno, uttered in malice, was brought to a
happy fulfilment, and turned into a matter of light
jesting by an innocent child.</p>

<p>On the day following Æneas chose out a hundred
men from all his company, and sent them as envoys
to the court of Latinus. Crowned with olive
wreaths, to show that they came in peace, they set
forth on their mission, and soon reached the open
plain which lies before the gates of Laurentum,
where the youth of Latium were assembled for the
practice of archery, horsemanship, and other warlike
exercises. Here they halted, and sent forward
a messenger to announce their coming to the king.
Permission being granted, they entered the gates
under an escort, and were conducted to the royal
palace, which stood on a hill, commanding the city,
and surrounded by a hallowed grove. Here they
were first ushered into an ante-chamber filled with
warlike trophies—chariots and the beaked prows of
ships, battle-axes, helmets, shields, and spears;
while round the walls were ranged statues of the
ancient kings and warriors of Latium. From here,
with all due ceremony, they were brought into the
presence of the king.</p>

<p>Benign was the face of the venerable Latinus,
and gracious were his words, as he gave welcome to
his guests. “Children of Dardanus,” he said, “I
know both your name and your fame, and ye come
not hither as strangers. Whether ye come to this
land of set purpose, or driven by adverse winds, I
regard you as friends, and in some wise as kinsmen.
Was not Dardanus, your ancestor, whose seat is
now in heaven, a son of Italy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>Ilioneus, the leader of the embassy, replied:
“Illustrious son of Saturn, it was no accident of
wind or weather which brought us to thy shores.
Thou knowest—as who doth not, dwell he never so
remote from the paths of men?—thou knowest the
tempest which gathered at Mycenæ and swept over
the plains of Asia. Saved from that deluge and the
havoc of our homes we have passed the wide waste
of waters, following the voice of Apollo, which
called us to the Tuscan Tiber and the cradle of our
race. We ask but a little gift—a small plot of earth
for our country’s gods to dwell in, and the common
boon of water and air. And despise us not, nor
think that we come as beggars and outcasts; many
are the nations who would have given us an honorable
portion in their land and received us as
friends and allies, but fate suffered it not. Receive
us, then, and take these gifts from the hands of
Æneas, a hand never stained by treachery or cowardice.
This is the golden goblet from which his
sire Anchises was wont to pour the drink-offering;
here is the royal robe and the scepter and tiara of
Priam; and these vestments were wrought by the
hands of noble Trojan dames.”</p>

<p>For a while Latinus sat silent, pondering on the
strange event, which seemed to fulfil the oracle
of ancient Faunus. This, thought he, is the
foreign bridegroom of which the oracle spoke.
Presently he raised his head, and answered, with
a look of glad assurance: “Trojan, thou hast thy
wish; and may the gods speed our designs! I
have a daughter who, by many sure tokens, is
destined to wed a stranger from a distant country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
and, unless my mind deceives me, your King
Æneas is called by fate to be her husband. Bid
him seek my presence with all speed, and doubt not
of his welcome.”</p>

<p>Such was the reply of Latinus; and his actions
were as kind as his words.…</p>

<p>Finding that Latinus was not to be shaken in his
resolve, Amata gave the reins to her frenzy, and
going forth into the city, sped from house to house
and poured her tale of wrong into the ears of all
whom she met.…</p>

<p>Thus what had begun as a petty brawl soon grew
into a regular battle, in which the whole Trojan
force found itself confronted by a strong muster
from the field of Latium.…</p>

<p>Æneas received an embassy sent by Latinus to
ask a truce for the burial of the slain. The envoys
were courteously received, and after granting their
request Æneas addressed them in terms of grave
and dignified remonstrance. “Why,” he asked,
“has your king broken faith with me thus, and
brought on Trojans and Latins this lamentable
war? If Turnus complains that I am robbing him
of his promised bride, let him make good his right
in single combat, and not sacrifice the lives of
thousands in a private quarrel. Tell him that I am
ready to meet him when and where he will.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_FIGHT_BETWEEN_AENEAS">THE FIGHT BETWEEN ÆNEAS
AND TURNUS</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">Turnus had declared himself ready to decide
the struggle in single combat with Æneas.
The time had now come for him to redeem his
pledge. The Latins were beaten and discouraged,
and all eyes were fixed upon him as the author and
cause of the war. The fiery spirit of the young
Rutulian rose under this trial; he sought an interview
with Latinus, and bade him send a herald to
demand a truce and arrange the preliminaries of
his duel with Æneas.</p>

<p>Latinus strove in vain to deter him from his
purpose; in vain Amata besought him with tears
and prayers not to drive matters to so desperate an
issue. Turnus fixed his eyes on the lovely form
and blushing features of Lavinia, who was standing
a silent witness of the scene, and, carried away
by passion, he answered in excited tones: “Urge me
no further, dear lady! The die is cast; I have given
my word, and cannot draw back now.” Then he
called an officer, and sent him with a flag of truce
to the Trojan camp, appointing the next day for
the encounter which was to settle his claim to the
hand of Lavinia and the scepter of Latium.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fatal day is come, and with the first gleam
of light Turnus leaps from his couch and prepares
himself for battle. Every tone and gesture of the
turbulent Rutulian betray wild exaltation of spirits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
“Come,” he cries, seizing a ponderous lance,
which quivered like a reed in his powerful grasp,
“come, good spear, that hast never failed me yet!
To-day thou shalt drink deep of a coward’s blood,
and the curled darling of Venus shall stain his
scented locks in the dust of Latium.”</p>

<p>On the other side Æneas armed himself with
calm confidence, secure in the sense of his lofty
mission. The lists were measured, and altars of
turf erected for the customary sacrifice. On either
side of the field the Trojans and Latins were drawn
up in battle array, and the walls of Laurentum
were thronged with women and old men, the passive
spectators of the approaching combat.</p>

<p>A loud shout from the ranks of the Latins announces
that the king is at hand, and soon Latinus
appears in the center of the arena, seated in a four-horse
car, and wearing his royal crown. Turnus
follows close behind, sheathed in complete armor,
and drawn by two snow-white steeds. Æneas
stands ready to receive them; the victims are
brought, the salted meal is sprinkled, and the sacred
forelock cut off from the forehead of the
victims. Then Æneas lifts up his hands, and makes
a solemn appeal to Jupiter and Juno and Mars,
and all the powers of earth and sky and sea: “Witness,
all ye eternal gods, and hear my vow: if Turnus
gains the mastery to-day the Trojans shall go
back to Evander’s city, and never bear arms against
this realm again; but if, as I hope and believe,
Heaven favors my sword, I claim not the sovereignty
of Latium, nor seek aught for myself and
my people but the right to dwell here in peace as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
friend and ally of the old inhabitants.” The oath
was solemnly repeated by Latinus and ratified by
sacrifice and prayer.</p>

<p>But the combat was not to proceed without interruption.
On a lofty hill, known in after days
as the Alban Mount, sat Juno, watching the scene
with jealous eyes. She observed with pity the pale
and downcast face of Turnus, whose courage began
to fail him as the fatal moment drew near; and,
resolved to make one more effort on his behalf, she
went in search of Juturna, a sister of Turnus, who
had been raised to divine honors by the special
favor of Jove, and made a presiding deity over
the fountains and rivers of Latium. “Up, Juturna,”
said the goddess, when she had found her
sitting pensively by a dear fountain-head; “go help
thy brother in his dire need. I can do no more.”</p>

<p>Starting up at the summons Juturna made
haste to obey, and a moment after she was standing
invisible among the Rutulians who fought under
Turnus. By their looks and words she soon perceived
that they were ripe for mischief; and
putting on the likeness of Camers, a brave warrior,
and friend of Turnus, she gave voice to the general
sentiment thus: “Are ye not ashamed, Rutulians,
that one man should give his life for you all?
Shall we, who outnumber the enemy by two to
one, sit idly by and see our leader slain and a chain
forged for our own necks?”</p>

<p>The words were caught up, and passed from rank
to rank; threatening murmurs arose among the
Rutulians, and even the Latins began to regret
that they had left their fate to be decided by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
sword of Turnus. In the midst of this excitement
a flight of wild swans was seen passing overhead,
pursued by an eagle, who swooped suddenly on
one of the finest of the birds, and began to bear him
off in his talons. Hereupon the whole troop rallied
to the rescue of their comrade, and so belabored
and buffeted the robber with their powerful wings
that he was compelled to drop his prey and seek
safety in flight. “Hear me,” cried Tolumnius, a
famous augur, “while I read you the omen. The
eagle is Æneas, and the swans who beat him off
are ourselves, the free sons of Italy, who will
forthwith drive this marauder across the sea
again.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word he ran forward,
and flung his spear. It flew hissing across the open
space which separated the two armies, and struck
a tall Arcadian, one of nine brothers, in the side.
He fell, mortally wounded, and his brethren, with
a cry of rage and grief, seized their weapons, and
rushed to avenge him. A general advance now
began on both sides; thick and fast flew the javelins;
and Latinus left the field in haste to escape
from that iron shower.</p>

<p>Æneas made desperate efforts to check the
furious passions which were raging around him.
Bareheaded and unarmed he flung himself into
the thick of the combatants, crying: “Are ye mad,
good people? Drop your weapons, and leave me
to seal the treaty with the blood of Turnus; his
life is now forfeited to me.” While thus he
pleaded and protested there came an arrow, shot
by an unknown hand, and struck him in the hip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
Grievously hurt Æneas was compelled to seek
shelter behind a friendly shield, and retired to the
rear, leaving the field open to Turnus.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of the fierce Rutulian when he
saw his enemy disabled and the bravest of the
Trojan leaders withdrawn from the conflict, in
anxious attendance on their injured chief. Mounting
his car he lashed his coursers to a gallop, and
scoured the plain, ravaging the ranks of the
Trojans and trampling them down by scores.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Æneas had retreated to the camp,
and was standing, surrounded by his friends, with
the arrow still planted deep in his flesh. The most
skilful leech in the Trojan army was a certain
Iapis, whom Apollo had loved in his youth, and
offered to endow with his own gifts as archer,
harper, and seer; but he, that he might prolong
the life of his father, who was sick unto death,
chose rather to learn the virtues of healing herbs
and all the physician’s lore. He now arrived, in
answer to a hasty summons, and employed all his
skill to draw the barbed arrow from the wound.
But all his efforts were in vain; the arrow clung
fast, and refused to stir. Louder and louder grew
the roar of battle; nearer and nearer came the
dense columns of the enemy, and their javelins
began to fall thick in the very center of the camp.</p>

<p>Venus saw her son’s dire strait, and came to his
aid, bearing in her hand a bunch of dittany, a
plant of wondrous healing powers, with downy
leaves and purple flower, often cropped by the
wild goats when they are wounded by the hunter’s
shaft. Unseen of any Venus drew near, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
dropped the magic herb into the vessel containing
the water with which Iapis was bathing the wound.
The leech, all unknowing, continued his ministrations;
and instantly, at the first touch of that
powerful remedy, all pain departed, the flow of
blood was stanched, and the arrow dropped
harmless to the ground. “This is no work of my
skill,” said Iapis in a voice full of awe; “the hand
of a god has been here.” Completely healed, with
all his pristine vigor restored, Æneas resumed his
armor, and kissing Iulus, who was standing near,
he seized his spear, and charged into the thickest
of the fight, followed close by the other Trojan
chiefs.</p>

<p>Juturna saw him coming, and, trembling for her
brother’s life, she approached the car of Turnus,
and flinging Metiscus, his charioteer, in the dust,
herself put on his likeness, and seized the reins.
Driven now by no mortal hand, the car flew hither
and thither with miraculous speed, wheeling and
darting in giddy circles, like a swallow pursuing
her tiny prey. Æneas panted in pursuit, scorning
every other foe, with eye and foot and hand all
directed against Turnus, and Turnus alone; now
he seemed to be gaining, and pressed forward,
calling on his enemy to stand; and the next
moment his prey was snatched from his grasp,
like a hare doubling to avoid the fangs of a hound.
Messapus, seeing him absorbed in the chase, and
thinking to catch him unawares, flung a javelin,
and struck off the plumes from his helmet. Then
at last Æneas gave reins to his anger, and, abandoning
the pursuit of Turnus, fell upon the foes who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
were nearest, and strewed the field with indiscriminate
carnage.</p>

<p>Thus fate for the moment kept the two rivals
apart, and they fought in different parts of the
field, like devastating fires which fall upon a forest
from opposite quarters, wasting the timber, till
with a roar they meet. At length Æneas paused
from the work of destruction, and, glancing backward
at the city, saw the walls feebly manned and
the path to the gates lying open. Such an opportunity
was not to be neglected. Hastily summoning
those next to himself in command he pointed to the
walls, and said: “There is the point at which we
must strike, and that speedily. If the Latins
will not confess themselves beaten, this day I will
raze their city to the ground. Gather your men,
and prepare to carry the place by storm.”</p>

<p>Wild was the dismay among the inhabitants of
Laurentum when they saw the Trojans and
Tuscans advancing in full force, with scaling
ladders, battering-rams, and torches, to the assault.
Some rushed to the battlements, determined
to resist to the last; others cried that the
gates must be opened to the enemy; and a third
party broke into the palace, and dragged the unhappy
Latinus into the streets, vowing that they
would hand him over to the vengeance of Æneas.
All was panic, confusion, and uproar, as in a nest
of wild bees smoked to death by a shepherd who
seeks to rifle their store. In the midst of this disorder
an event occurred which gave the last blow
to those who still favored the cause of Turnus.
When the queen saw the approaching attack on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
the city she at once concluded that Turnus had
fallen, and, full of remorse for the part which she
had played, she went and hanged herself from a
high beam in her chamber.</p>

<h3 id="THE_DEATH_OF_TURNUS">THE DEATH OF TURNUS</h3>

<p class="author">By H. L. Havell</p>

<p class="dropcap">Turnus, whose car was still driven by the
disguised Juturna, had been carried in pursuit
of some straggling Trojans to the farthest verge of
the plain. Suddenly his ears were caught by a wild,
tumultuous cry from the distant city, and, laying
his hand on the reins, he brought the chariot to
a stand. “Why haltest thou?” asked the pretended
Metiscus. “Leave thy comrades to defend
the walls, and continue the work of slaughter here,
where there is none to oppose thee.” Turnus
answered: “Sister, I knew thee from the first,
and recognized thy hand in all the wild havoc of
this day. But vain are all thy labors; Heaven
is against me, and I must bow to the will of fate.
I have seen all the noblest of my comrades slain
before my eyes; shall I suffer this royal city to be
given up to fire and slaughter for my sake? Shall
I play coward, and make my name a byword for
Drances and his crew? No, if Heaven is against
me, be ye at least with me, ye noble spirits of the
dead! Prepare to receive me, a stainless soul,
worthy to be numbered among the mightiest of
my line.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when a Rutulian horseman,
wounded in the face by an arrow, came
galloping towards him, shouting: “Turnus, what
doest thou here? Thou art our last hope and
refuge; the city is beset, Amata has died by her
own hand; but few of thy friends remain to keep
up a desperate defence. Come quickly, for dire
is the need.” As if to give point to his words,
at this very moment the flames were seen leaping
from a huge wooden tower built on a projection of
the walls. For a while Turnus stood as if stupefied,
overcome by the conflicting passions which surged
within him. Then, collecting himself with a strong
effort, he said: “’Tis enough; my fate calls me,
and I obey. Let me strike one good blow first,
and then let death take his due.” Thereupon he
sprang from the chariot, and, running at full
speed, broke his way through the fighting lines,
like a great boulder sapped in its foundations by
the winter rains and toppled from a mountain’s
crest. “Make way,” he cried; “drop your
weapons, ye Rutulians and Latins. This is my
quarrel, not yours, and I am come to pay the
price.”</p>

<p>Both sides fell back, and left an open space
for the final encounter between the two great
champions. “At last!” murmured Æneas as he
came towering on, and took his stand, “like Teneriffe
or Atlas unremoved,” face to face with his
giant foe. First they flung their spears, and, these
not taking effect, they drew their swords, and
engaged hand to hand. Loud clashed the steel,
and a stream of lightning seemed to play about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
their heads, so fast and furious were the strokes.
Like two bulls fighting for the sovereignty of the
herd, while the kine stand lowing near, so strove
the Italian and the Trojan for the mastery, foot
to foot and shield to shield. At length Turnus
lifted high his sword, and, coming down with the
whole weight of his body, discharged a tremendous
blow at the crest of Æneas. The weapon belonged
to Metiscus, his charioteer, and he had snatched
it up in mistake for his own good blade, which had
been tempered by the hand of Vulcan himself.
And now the faithless sword proved its mortal
temper, and was shivered to the hilt like glass.
With a bitter curse the Rutulian turned his back,
and fled, and Æneas followed close, though still
somewhat disabled by his recent wound. Hither
and thither they sped, pursuer and pursued, as a
keen hound chases the flying deer, brought to bay
by a high rocky mountain-side; the stag wheels
and doubles, and the hound’s jaws close with a
snap, as his quarry eludes him again.</p>

<p>Turnus shouted to his comrades, imploring them
to bring his sword, but Æneas warned them off
with threatening gestures; and so the race went on,
which was run for no common stake, but for the
very life blood of Turnus.</p>

<p>When Æneas flung his spear at the beginning of
the duel the weapon had sunk deep into the stump
of an olive-tree; the tree itself, which was sacred
to Faunus, had been felled by the Trojans, and
rolled out of the way, on the morning before the
battle. Catching sight of the spear as he ran
past in pursuit of Turnus, Æneas paused, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
strove to tear it out. In wild terror Turnus
watched his efforts, and cried: “Faunus, god of
my fathers, hold the weapon fast, and preserve
thy worshiper!” Faunus heard his prayer, and
kept the iron point close pinned in the knotted roots
of his sacred tree; and while Æneas was still
tugging and straining at the shaft, Juturna, again
disguised as Metiscus, ran up to Turnus, and gave
him back his sword. Thereupon Venus, angered
by the presumption of the nymph, drew near in
her turn, wrenched out the lance, and handed it
to her son. Their weapons thus restored the
champions stood face to face once more, prepared
to renew the battle.</p>

<p>But the end was now at hand. Jove sat watching
the rival warriors, and weary that the inevitable
issue should be so long delayed he thus addressed
his haughty consort: “Juno, how long must I
suffer thee to thwart my high purpose? Thou
knowest that it is in vain. Surely thy hate should
now be satisfied, after so many years in which thy
malice has ranged unchecked and strewn the path
of Æneas with death and disaster. The word must
now be spoken: Cease; I forbid thee to go further.”
Juno answered humbly: “Be it so! I also am
weary of the fray, and will resist no more. One
thing only I ask, which fate forbids thee not to
grant: when the two peoples have united into one,
let the language and the dress and the customs
of Italy survive, and let the whole nation be called
the Latins. Troy has perished; let her name
perish also.” Jove smiled indulgently as he replied:
“True daughter of Saturn, still unappeasable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
in thine ire, it shall be as thou sayest. Latins
they shall be called, and they shall be thy people,
mighty in word and deed, and laud and honor
thy name for ever.”</p>

<p>The old quarrel thus happily concluded, Jove
prepared to end the conflict between Æneas and
Turnus. Close by his throne two hideous warders
lie couched day and night, sisters of the Furies,
and armed with the same attributes of terror,
with serpent tresses, and windy wings. One of
these the monarch of heaven sent to warn Juturna
that she must leave her brother’s side. Like a
poisoned arrow shot from a Parthian’s bow the
daughter of Night sped down to earth, and as
she came in sight of the Trojan and Latin armies,
she took the shape of that ill-omened bird who sits
among tombs and ruined towers, and sends her
moaning cry through the darkness. In such shape
the fiend dashed herself against the face of Turnus,
and buffeted his shield with her wings.</p>

<p>Turnus was paralyzed with horror; his hair
bristled, and the passage of his voice was choked.
But when Juturna heard the beating of those
fatal pinions she tore her hair, and beat her
breast, knowing that her brother’s hour was come.
“Turnus, I can do no more,” she cried. “Would
that I might die with thee! But, alas! Jove has
made me immortal, and doomed me to eternal
sorrow.” Then, veiling her face in her azure
mantle, the nymph left the battlefield, and sat
rocking herself in anguish by the river-side.</p>

<p>Æneas came on, brandishing his massy spear,
and crying: “Now at last thou art delivered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
my hands, unless thou canst fly up to heaven or
dig thee a burrow in the earth.” “Thy words
have no terrors for me,” replied Turnus, “but
much I fear that Heaven is against me.” And
without more words he looked round him, and
saw a huge ancient stone, set up long ago as a
boundary mark. Stooping he caught up the
ponderous mass, which scarce twelve men could
lift, as men are in our times; with one hand he
heaved it above his head, and poised and flung it,
running at full speed. It was his last effort, and
he felt as he made it that his powers were failing.
The stone fell short, and Turnus stood gazing,
struck with a strange impotence, like one in a
trance; the whole scene swam before his eyes,
woods, hills, and city walls, and the faces of his
friends, like visions in a fevered dream.</p>

<p>While thus he faltered Æneas poised his lance,
took steady aim and flung. Like some vast
missile hurled by a siege engine the giant spear
rushed to its mark, pierced through the lower edge
of the sevenfold shield, and, rending the border of
the corslet with a grating sound, transfixed the
middle of his thigh. A deep groan went up from
the ranks of the Rutulians when they saw their
young hero lying, helpless and bleeding, on the
sand.</p>

<p>With hands outstretched and eyes imploring
mercy Turnus uttered this humble prayer: “Thou
hast conquered; Lavinia is thine; now pity my
father’s gray hairs, and give him back his son, or
if thou must have my life at least restore my
body to him for burial.” Æneas paused, lowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
his sword and rolling his eyes, in doubt whether
to strike or spare; and pity began to prevail more
and more in his heart when his gaze fastened on
the fatal belt, which Turnus had won from the
youthful Pallas, and was wearing on his shoulder.
Then grief and anger blazed up in his soul, and he
cried in a terrible voice: “Wretch, dost thou ask
for mercy with that emblem of sorrow on thy
breast? Pallas, Pallas claims thee as his victim,
and cries aloud for thy guilty blood.”</p>

<p>The avenging steel was lifted, and flashed, and
fell; and that mighty frame lay shuddering in
death, while his soul, indignant, fled moaning to
the shades.</p>

<h3 id="THE_STORY_OF_ROMULUS_AND">THE STORY OF ROMULUS AND
OF NUMA</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">Æneas of Troy, coming to the land of
Italy, took to wife Lavinia, daughter of
King Latinus, and built him a city, which he called
Lavinium, after the name of his wife. And, after
thirty years, his son Ascanius went forth from
Lavinium with much people, and built him a new
city, which he called Alba. In this city reigned
kings of the house and lineage of Æneas for twelve
generations. Of these kings the eleventh in descent
was one Procas, who, having two sons, Numitor
and Amulius, left his kingdom, according to the
custom, to Numitor, the elder. But Amulius drave
out his brother, and reigned in his stead. Nor was
he content with this wickedness, but slew all the
male children of his brother. And the daughter of
his brother, that was named Rhea Silvia, he chose
to be a priestess of Vesta, making as though he
would do the maiden honor, but his thought was
that the name of his brother should perish, for they
that serve Vesta are vowed to perpetual virginity.</p>

<p>But it came to pass that Rhea bare twin sons,
whose father, it was said, was the god Mars. Very
wroth was Amulius when he heard this thing; Rhea
he made fast in prison, and the children he gave to
certain of his servants that they should cast them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
into the river. Now it chanced that at this season
Tiber had overflowed his banks, neither could the
servants come near to the stream of the river;
nevertheless they did not doubt that the children
would perish, for all that the overflowing of the
water was neither deep nor of a swift current.
Thinking then that they had duly performed the
commandment of the king, they set down the babes
in the flood and departed. But after a while the
flood abated, and left the basket wherein the children
had been laid on dry ground. And a she-wolf,
coming down from the hill to drink at the
river (for the country in those days was desert and
abounding in wild beasts), heard the crying of the
children and ran to them. Nor did she devour
them, but gave them suck; nay, so gentle was she
that Faustulus, the king’s shepherd, chancing to
go by, saw that she licked them with her tongue.
This Faustulus took the children and gave them to
his wife to rear; and these, when they were of age
to go by themselves, were not willing to abide with
the flocks and herds, but were hunters, wandering
through the forests that were in those parts. And
afterward, being now come to full strength, they
were not content to slay wild beasts only, but would
assail troops of robbers, as these were returning
laden with their booty, and would divide the spoils
among the shepherds. Now there was held in those
days, on the hill that is now called the Palatine, a
yearly festival to the god Pan. This festival King
Evander first ordained, having come from Arcadia,
in which land, being a land of shepherds, Pan that
is the god of shepherds is greatly honored. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
when the young men and their company (for they
had gathered a great company of shepherds about
them, and led them in all matters both of business
and of sport) were busy with the festival, there
came upon them certain robbers that had made an
ambush in the place, being very wroth by reason
of the booty which they had lost. These laid hands
on Remus, but Romulus they could not take, so
fiercely did he fight against them. Remus, therefore,
they delivered up to King Amulius, accusing
him of many things and chiefly of this, that he and
his companions had invaded the land of Numitor,
dealing with them in the fashion of an enemy and
carrying off much spoil. To Numitor, therefore,
did the king deliver Remus, that he might put him
to death. Now Faustulus had believed from the
beginning that the children were of the royal house,
for he knew that the babes had been cast into the
river by the king’s command, and the time also of
his finding them agreed thereto. Nevertheless he
had not judged it expedient to open the matter before
due time, but waited till occasion or necessity
should arise. But now, there being such necessity,
he opened the matter to Romulus. Numitor
also, when he had the young man Remus in his
custody, knowing that he and his brother were
twins, and that the time agreed, and seeing that
they were of a high spirit, bethought him of his
grandsons; and, indeed, having asked many questions
of Remus, was come nigh to knowing of what
race he was. And now also Romulus was ready to
help his brother. To come openly with his whole
company he dared not, for he was not a match for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
the power of King Amulius; but he bade sundry
shepherds make their way to the palace, each as
best he could, appointing to them a time at which
they should meet. And now came Remus also,
with a troop of youths gathered together from the
household of Numitor. Then did Romulus and
Remus slay King Amulius. In the meanwhile
Numitor gathered the youth of Alba to the citadel,
crying out that they must make the place safe,
for that the enemy was upon them; but when he
perceived that the young men had done the deed,
forthwith he called an assembly of the citizens, and
set forth to them the wickedness which his brother
had wrought against him, and how his grandsons
had been born and bred and made known to him,
and then, in order, how the tyrant had been slain,
himself having counselled the deed. When he had
so spoken the young men came with their company
into the midst of the assembly, and saluted him as
King; to which thing the whole multitude agreeing
with one consent, Numitor was established upon
the throne.</p>

<p>After this Romulus and his brother conceived
this purpose, that, leaving their grandfather to be
king at Alba, they should build for themselves a
new city in the place where, having been at the first
left to die, they had been brought up by Faustulus
the shepherd. And to this purpose many agreed
both of the men of Alba and of the Latins, and
also of the shepherds that had followed them from
the first, holding it for certain all of them that
Alba and Lavinium would be of small account in
comparison of this new city which they should build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
together. But while the brothers were busy with
these things, there sprang up afresh the same evil
thing which had before wrought such trouble in
their house, even the lust of power. For though
the beginnings of the strife between them were
peaceful, yet did it end in great wickedness. The
matter fell out in this wise. Seeing that the brothers
were twins, and that neither could claim to have
the preference to the other in respect of his age,
it was agreed between them that the gods that were
the guardians of that country should make known
by means of augury which of the two they chose
to give his name to the new city. Then Romulus
stood on the Palatine hill, and when there had been
marked out for him a certain region of the sky,
watched therein for a sign; and Remus watched in
like manner, standing on the Aventine. And to
Remus first came a sign, six vultures; but so soon
as the sign had been proclaimed there came another
to Romulus, even twelve vultures. Then they that
favored Remus clamored that the gods had chosen
him for king, because he had first seen the birds;
and they that favored Romulus answered that he
was to be preferred because he had seen more in
number. This dispute waxed so hot that they fell
to fighting; and in the fight it chanced that Remus
was slain. But some say that when Romulus had
marked out the borders of the town which he would
build, and had caused them to build a wall round
it, Remus leapt over the wall, scorning it because
it was mean and low; and that Romulus slew him,
crying out, “Thus shall every man perish that shall
dare to leap over my walls.” Only others will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
it that though he perished for this cause Romulus
slew him not, but a certain Celer. This much is
certain, that Romulus gained the whole kingdom
for himself and called the city after his own name.</p>

<p>After this the people bethought themselves how
they should get for themselves wives, for there
were no women in the place. Wherefore Romulus
sent ambassadors to the nations round about, praying
that they should give their daughters to his people
for wives. “Cities,” he said, “have humble beginnings
even as all other things. Nevertheless
they that have the gods and their own valor to help
become great. Now that the gods are with us, as
ye know, be assured also that valor shall not be
wanting.” But the nations round about would not
hearken to him, thinking scorn of this gathering of
robbers and slaves and runaways, so that they said,
“Why do ye not open a sanctuary for women also
that so ye may find fit wives for your people?”
Also they feared for themselves and their children
what this new city might grow to. Now when
the ambassadors brought back this answer the Romans
were greatly wroth, and would take by force
that which their neighbors would not give of their
free will. And to the end that they might do this
more easily, King Romulus appointed certain days
whereon he and his people would hold a festival
with games to Neptune; and to this festival he
called all them that dwelt in the cities round about.
But when many were gathered together (for they
were fain to see what this new city might be), and
were now wholly bent on the spectacle of the
games, the young men of the Romans ran in upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
them, and carried off all such as were unwedded
among the women. To these King Romulus spake
kindly, saying, “The fault is not with us but with
your fathers, who dealt proudly with us, and would
not give you to us in marriage. But now ye shall
be held in all honor as our wives, and shall have
your portion of all that we possess. Put away
therefore your anger, for ye shall find us so much
the better husbands than other men, as we must be
to you not for husbands only but parents also and
native country.”</p>

<p>After this, King Tatius and the Sabines came
up against Rome with a great army. And first of
all they gained the citadel by treachery in this manner.
One Tarpeius was governor of the citadel,
whose daughter, Tarpeia by name, going forth
from the walls to fetch water for a sacrifice, took
money from the king that she should receive certain
of the soldiers within the citadel; but when
they had been so received, the men cast their shields
upon her, slaying her with the weight of them.
This they did either that they might be thought
to have taken the place by force, or that they
judged it to be well that no faith should be kept
with traitors. Some also tell this tale, that the
Sabines wore great bracelets of gold on their left
arms, and on their left hands fair rings with precious
stones therein, and that when the maiden
covenanted with them that she should have for a
reward that which they carried in their left hands,
they cast their shields upon her. And others say
that she asked for their shields, having the purpose
to betray them, and for this cause was slain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Sabines had possession of the citadel;
and the next day King Romulus set the battle in
array on the plain that lay between the hill of the
Capitol and the hill of the Palatine. And first the
Romans were very eager to recover the citadel, a
certain Hostilius being their leader. But when this
man, fighting in the forefront of the battle, was
slain, the Romans turned their backs and fled before
the Sabines, even unto the gate of the Palatine.
Then King Romulus (for he himself had been carried
away by the crowd of them that fled) held up
his sword and his spear to the heavens, and cried
aloud, “O Jupiter, here in the Palatine didst thou
first, by the tokens which thou sentest me, lay the
foundations of my city. And lo! the Sabines have
taken the citadel by wicked craft, and have crossed
the valley, and are come up even hither. But if
thou sufferest them so far, do thou at the least defend
this place against them, and stay this shameful
flight of my people. So will I build a temple for
thee in this place, even a temple of Jupiter the
Stayer, that may be a memorial to after generations
of how thou didst this day save this city.”
And when he had so spoken, even as though he
knew that the prayer had been heard, he cried, “Ye
men of Rome, Jupiter bids you stand fast in this
place and renew the battle.” And when the men
of Rome heard these words, it was as if a voice
from heaven had spoken to them, and they stood
fast, and the king himself went forward and stood
among the foremost. Now the leader of the Sabines
was one Curtius. This man, as he drave the
Romans before him, cried out to his comrades, “See,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
we have conquered these men, false hosts and feeble
foes that they are! Surely now they know that it
is one thing to carry off maidens and another to
fight with men.” But whilst he boasted himself
thus, King Romulus and a company of the youth
rushed upon him. Now Curtius was fighting on
horseback, and being thus assailed he fled, plunging
into a certain pool which lay between the Palatine
hill and the Capitol. Thus did he barely escape
with his life, and the lake was called thereafter
Curtius’ pool. And now the Sabines began
to give way to the Romans, when suddenly the
women for whose sake they fought, having their
hair loosened and their garments rent, ran in between
them that fought, crying out, “Shed ye not
each other’s blood ye that are fathers-in-law and
sons-in-law to each other. But if ye break this
bond that is between you, slay us that are the cause
of this trouble. And surely it were better for us
to die than to live if we be bereaved of our fathers
or of our husbands.” With these words they
stirred the hearts both of the chiefs and of the
people, so that there was suddenly made a great
silence. And afterward the leaders came forth to
make a covenant; and these indeed so ordered matters
that there was not peace only, but one state
where there had been two. For the Sabines came
to Rome and dwelt there; and King Romulus and
King Tatius reigned together. Only, after a while,
certain men of Lanuvium slew King Tatius as he
was sacrificing to the gods at Lavinium; and thereafter
Romulus only was king as before.</p>

<p>When he had reigned thirty and seven years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
there befell the thing that shall now be told. On a
certain day he called the people together on the
field of Mars, and held a review of his army. But
while he did this there arose suddenly a great storm
with loud thunderings and very thick clouds, so
that the king was hidden away from the eyes of all
the people. Nor indeed was he ever again seen
upon the earth.</p>

<p>And now it was needful that another king should
be chosen. No man in those days was more renowned
for his righteousness and piety than a certain
Numa Pompilius that dwelt at Cures in the
land of the Sabines. Now it seemed at first to the
Senate that the Sabines would be too powerful in
the state if the king should be chosen from among
them, nevertheless because they could not agree
upon any other man, at last with one consent they
decreed that the kingdom should be offered to him.
And Numa was willing to receive it if only the
gods consented. And the consent of the gods was
asked in this fashion. Being led by the augur into
the citadel, he sat down on a stone with his face
looking toward the south, and on his left hand sat
the augur, having his head covered and in his hand
an augur’s staff, which is a wand bent at the end
and having no knot. Then looking toward the city
and the country round about, he offered prayers
to the gods and marked out the region of the sky
from the sunrising to the sunsetting; the parts toward
the south he called the right; and the parts
toward the north he called the left; and he set a
boundary before as far as his eye could reach.
After this he took his staff in his left hand and laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
his right on the head of Numa, praying in these
words: “Father Jupiter, if it be thy will that this
Numa Pompilius, whose head I hold, should be
King of Rome, show us, I pray thee, clear tokens
of this thy will within the space which I have
marked out.” He then named the tokens which he
desired, and when they had been shown, Numa was
declared to be king.</p>

<p>Many other things did King Numa set in order
for his people. First he divided the year into
twelve months, each month being according to the
course of the moon, and in every twenty-fourth
year another month, that the year might so agree
with the course of the sun. Also he appointed certain
lawful days for business, and other days on
which nothing might be done. He made priests
also, of whom the chief was the priest of Jupiter,
to whom he gave splendid apparel and a chair of
ivory. Two other priests he made, one of Mars,
and the other of Quirinus, that is to say, of Romulus
the god. And he chose virgins for the service
of Vesta, who should keep alive the sacred fire, and
twelve priests of Mars, whom he called the Salii, to
be keepers of the sacred shield. (This shield, men
said, fell down from heaven, and that it might be
kept the more safely, King Numa commanded that
they should make eleven other shields like unto it.)
This shield and its fellows the Salii were to carry
through the city, having on flowered tunics and
breastplates of brass, and dancing and singing
hymns. And many other things as to the worship
of the gods, and the interpreting of signs, and the
dealing with marvels and portents, King Numa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
set in order. And that the people might regard
these laws and customs with the more reverence,
he gave out that he had not devised them of his
own wit, but that he had learnt them from a certain
goddess whose name was Egeria, whom he was
wont to meet in a grove that was hard by the city.</p>

<p>King Numa died, having reigned forty and three
years; and the people chose in his room one Tullus
Hostilius.</p>

<h3 id="THE_STORY_OF_ALBA">THE STORY OF ALBA</h3>

<p class="author">By Alfred J. Church</p>

<p class="dropcap">King Tullus Hostilius, being newly
come to the throne, looked about for an occasion
of war; for the Romans had now for a long
time been at peace. Now it chanced that in those
days the men of Rome and the men of Alba had
a quarrel, the one against the other, the country
folk being wont to cross the border and to plunder
their neighbors; and that ambassadors were sent
from either city to seek restitution of such things
as had been carried off. King Tullus said to his
ambassador, “Delay not to do your business so
soon as ye shall be come to Alba”; knowing that
the men of Alba would certainly refuse to deliver
up the things, and thinking that he could thus with
a good conscience proclaim war against them. As
for the ambassadors of Alba, when they were come
to Rome, they made no haste about their business,
but ate and drank, the king entertaining them with
much courtesy and kindness. While therefore they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
feasted with him, there came back the ambassadors
of Rome telling the king how they had made demand
for the things carried off, and when the men
of Alba had refused to deliver them, had declared
war within the space of thirty days. Which when
the king heard, he called to him the ambassadors
of Alba, and said to them, “Wherefore are ye come
to Rome? Set forth now your mission.” Then
the men, not knowing what had befallen, began to
make excuse, saying, “We would not willingly say
aught that should displease the king, but we are
constrained by them that have sent us thither. We
are come to ask for the things that your country
folk have carried off. And, if ye will not deliver
them up, we are bidden to declare war against you.”
To this Tullus made answer, “Now do I call to the
gods to witness that ye men of Alba first refused
to repair the thing that has been done amiss, and I
pray them that they will bring all the blood of this
war upon your heads.” And with this message the
men of Alba went home.</p>

<p>After this the two cities made great preparations
for war. And because the men of Troy had built
Lavinium, from which some going forth had set
up the city of Alba, and from the royal house of
Alba had come the founder of Rome, it was as
though the children would fight against their fathers.
Yet it came not to this, the matter being
finished without a battle. The men of Alba first
marched into the land of the Romans, having with
them a very great army, and pitched their camp
five miles from the city, digging about it a deep
ditch. But while they lay in this camp their King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
Cluilius died, and a certain Mettus was made dictator
in his room. Which when King Tullus heard,
he became very bold, saying that the gods had
smitten Cluilius for his wrong-doing, and would
smite also the whole people of Alba. Whereupon
he marched into the land of the Albans, leaving
the enemy’s camp to one side. And when these
also had come forth against him, and the two armies
were now drawn up in battle array, the one against
the other, there came a messenger to King Tullus,
saying that Mettus of Alba desired to have speech
with him, having that to say to him which concerned
the Romans not less than the men of Alba. Nor
did King Tullus refuse to hear him, though indeed
battle had pleased him better than speech. So
when the king and certain nobles with him had
gone forth into the open space that was between
the two armies, and Mettus also with his companions
had come to the same place, this last spake,
saving, “I have heard King Cluilius that is dead
affirm that your wrong-doing, ye men of Rome, in
that ye would not deliver up the things that had
been carried off, was the cause of this war; nor do
I doubt but that thou, King Tullus, hast the same
quarrel against us. Yet if we would speak that
which is true rather than that which has a fair show,
we should, I doubt not, confess that we, though
we be both kinsmen and neighbors, are driven
into this war by the lust of power. Now I say not
whether this be just or no. Let others look to this;
for I am not king of Alba, but captain of the host
only. Yet there is a matter which I would fain call
to thy mind, king. Thou knowest the Etruscans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
how mighty they are both by land and sea; for indeed
they are nearer by far to thee at Rome than
to us at Alba. Bethink thee, therefore, how, when
thou shalt give the signal of battle between thy
army and our army, the same Etruscans will look
on, rejoicing to see us fight together; and how, when
the battle is ended, they will fall upon us, having
us at disadvantage; for of a truth, whether ye or we
prevail, we shall have but little strength remaining
to us. If therefore we be not content with the
freedom that we have, but must needs set on the
chance of a die whether we shall be masters or servants,
let us devise some way by which the one may
win dominion over the other without great loss
and shedding of blood.” Now King Tullus was a
great warrior, and would willingly have fought,
being confident that he and his people would prevail;
nevertheless the thing that Mettus of Alba
had said pleased him. And when they came to consider
the matter, there seemed by good fortune to
be a way ready to their hands. There were in the
army of Alba three brothers that had been born
at one birth, whose name was Curiatius. And in
the army of the Romans there were other three and
these born likewise at one birth, whose name was
Horatius. Nor was there much difference in respect
either of age or of strength between the brothers
of Alba and the brothers of Rome. Then King
Tullus and Mettus of Alba called for the brothers,
and inquired of them whether they were willing to
fight each three for their own country, agreement
being first made that that people should bear rule
forever whose champions should prevail in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
battle. And as the young men were willing, a place
was appointed for the battle and a time also. But
first there was made a treaty in this fashion, for the
fashion of making treaties is the same always,
though their conditions be different. The herald
said, “Wilt thou, King Tullus, that I make a treaty
with the minister of the people of Alba?” And
when the king answered “Yea,” the herald said,
“I will that thou give me the sacred herbs.” Then
the king made reply, “Take them, and see that they
be clean.” So the herald took them clean from the
hill of the citadel. Having done this, he said to
the king, “Dost thou appoint me to do the pleasure
of the people of Rome, me and my implements and
my attendants with me?” And the king answered,
“So that it be without damage to the people of
Rome.” Then the herald appointed one Spurius to
be minister that he should take the oath, and
touched his hair with the sacred herbs. And when
Spurius had taken the oath, and the conditions of
the treaty had been read aloud, he spake, saying,
“Hear thou, Jupiter, and thou also, minister of the
people of Alba, and ye men of Alba; as these conditions
have been duly read aloud this day from the
beginning even to the end from these tables, and
after the interpretation by which they may be the
most easily understood, even so shall the Roman
people abide by them. And if this people, acting
by common consent, shall falsely depart from them,
then do thou, O Jupiter, smite the Roman people,
even as I shall smite this swine to-day. And smite
them by so much the more strongly as thou art
stronger than I.” And when he had said this he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
smote the swine with a knife of stone. The men of
Alba also took the oath, and confirmed it after
their own fashion. These things having been thus
ordered, the champions made them ready for battle.
And first their fellows exhorted them severally
in many words, saying that the gods of their country,
their countrymen also and kinsfolk, whether
they tarried at home or stood in the field, regarded
their arms that day; and afterward they went forth
into the space that lay between the two armies.
And these sat and watched them before their camps,
being quit indeed of the peril of battle, but full of
care how the matter should end, seeing that so great
things, even sovereignty and freedom, should be
decided by the valor and good luck of so few men.
Then the signal of battle being given, the three met
the three with such courage and fierceness as
though there were a whole army on either side.
And as their swords rang against each other and
flashed, all men trembled to see, and could scarcely
speak or breathe for fear of what should happen.
And for a while, in so narrow a space did the men
fight, nought could be seen but how they swayed
to and fro, and how the blood ran down upon the
ground. But afterward it was plain to see that of
the three Romans two were fallen dead upon the
ground, and that of the three champions of Alba
each man was wounded. At this sight the Alban
host shouted for joy, but the men of Rome had no
more any hope but only fear to think what should
befall their one champion that had now three enemies
against him. Now, by good luck, it had so
fallen out that this one had received no wound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
so that, though he was no match for the three together,
he did not doubt but that he should prevail
over them severally one by one. Wherefore, that
he might so meet them, dividing them the one from
the other, he made a feint to fly, thinking that they
would follow him each as quickly as his wound
might suffer him. And so it fell out. For when he
had fled now no small space from the ground where
they had fought at the first, he saw, looking behind
him, that the three were following him at a great
distance one from the other, and that one was very
near to himself. Then he turned himself and ran
fiercely upon the man; and behold even while the
men of Alba cried aloud to the two that they should
help their brother, he had slain him, and was now
running toward the second. And when the men
of Rome saw what had befallen, they set up a great
shout, as men are wont when they have good luck
beyond their hopes; and their champion made such
haste to do his part that or ever the third of the
Alban three could come up, though indeed he was
close at hand, he had slain the second also. And
now, seeing that there remained one only on either
side, there was in some sort an equality, yet were
the two not equal either in hope or in strength.
For the champion of Rome had suffered no wound,
and having overcome his foes now once and again
was full of courage; but the champion of Alba being
now spent with his wound, and wearied also
with running, was as it were vanquished already.
Nor indeed was there a battle between the two; for
the Roman cried, “One and another of my foes I
have offered to the spirits of my brothers; but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
third will I offer to the cause for which we have
fought this day, even that Rome may have the dominion
over Alba.” And when the champion of
Alba could now scarce bear up his shield, he stood
over and ran his sword downward into his throat.
Afterward as the man lay dead upon the ground,
he spoiled him of his arms. Then did the men of
Rome receive their champion with much rejoicing,
having all the more gladness because they had been
in so great fear. Afterward each host set themselves
to bury their dead, whose tombs remain to
this day, each in the spot where he fell, for the two
Romans are buried in one sepulcher nearer to Alba,
and the three champions of Alba as you go toward
Rome, but with somewhat of space between them,
even as they fought.</p>

<p>And now the men of Rome went back to the city,
and Horatius went before them, carrying the spoils
of the three whom he had slain. But at the
Capene gate there met him his sister, who was betrothed
to one of the champions of Alba; and when
the maiden saw upon his shoulders the cloak of her
betrothed (and indeed she had wrought it with her
own hands) she tore her hair and cried to the dead
man by name with a lamentable voice. But Horatius
was wroth to hear the words of mourning on
the day when he had won so great a victory and the
people rejoiced; and he drew his sword and slew
the maiden, crying, “Depart hence to thy lover
with the love that thou cherishest out of season;
thou that forgettest thy brethren that are dead, and
thy brother that is yet alive, and thine own people
also. So perish whosoever shall make lamentations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
for an enemy of Rome.” And when the fathers
and the commons saw what was done, they thought
it a wicked deed, but remembered what great service
the man had newly rendered to Rome. Nevertheless
they laid hands on him and took him to the
king that he should judge him. But the king being
loath to judge such a matter, or to give sentence
against the man, said, “I appoint two men as the
law commands, who shall judge Horatius for murder.”
Now the law was this: “If a man do murder,
two men shall judge him; if he appeal against
the two, let the appeal be tried; if their sentence be
confirmed, ye shall cover his head and scourge him
within the walls or without the walls, and hang him
by a rope upon the gallows.” Then there were appointed
two men according to the law, who affirmed
that they could not let the man go free,
whether his guilt was small or great, seeing that he
had manifestly done the deed. Therefore said one
of them, “Publius Horatius, we adjudge thee to
be guilty of murder. Go, lictor, bind his hands.”
But when the lictor came and was now ready to
cast the rope about him, Horatius cried, “I appeal
to the people;” for the king himself, being mercifully
disposed to him, bade him do so. Then was
there a trial before the people, in which that which
most wrought upon the hearts of men was that the
father of Horatius constantly affirmed that his
daughter had been rightly slain. “Nay,” said he,
“verily, if the young man had not slain her, I had
used against him my right as a father, and had
condemned him to die.” Then again he besought
them that they should not leave him desolate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
bereaved of his children, he who but the day before
had had so fair a stock. Afterward, throwing his
arms about the young man, he stretched out his
hands to the spoils of the Curiatii, crying, “Will ye
endure, men of Rome, to see him bound under the
gallows and beaten with stripes whom ye beheld
but yesterday adorned with these spoils and rejoicing
in his victory? Not so. Surely the men of
Alba themselves had not borne to see such a sight.
Go, lictor, bind his hands, though but yesterday
they won so great a dominion for the people of
Rome. Go, cover the head of him that made this
people free; hang him upon the accursed tree;
scourge him, whether within the walls, so that thou
do it among the spoils of them that he slew, or
without the walls, so that it be near to the sepulchers
of the champions of Alba. Whither can ye take
this youth that the memorials of his valor shall not
save him from so foul a punishment?” And when
the people saw the tears of the old man, and bethought
them also what great courage the youth
had shown in danger, they could not endure to condemn
him; but regarding his valor rather than the
goodness of his cause, let him go free. Only, because
the deed had been so manifest, a command
was laid upon the father that he should make a
trespass offering for his son at the public charge.
Then the father, having made certain sacrifices of
expiation—which are performed to this day in the
house of Horatius—set up a beam across the way
and covered his son’s head, and led him beneath it.
As for the maiden, they built her tomb of hewn
stone in the place where she was slain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the men of Alba were wroth to think that
the fortunes of the whole people had been thus
trusted to the hands of three soldiers; and Mettus,
being of an unstable mind, was led away to evil in
his desire to do them a pleasure. And as before
he had sought for peace when others were desirous
of war, so now he desired war when others were
minded to be at peace. But because he knew that
the men of Alba were not able of their own
strength to do that which they desired, he stirred
up certain others of the nations round about, that
they should make war openly against Rome. As
for himself and his people, he purposed that they
should seem indeed to be friends and allies, but
should be ready for treachery when occasion served.
Thereupon the men of Fidenæ, being colonists from
Rome, and the men of Veii promised that they
would make war, and Mettus on his part promised
that he would come over to them with his army in
the battle. First the men of Fidenæ rebelled, and
King Tullus marched against them, bidding Mettus
come also with his army, and having crossed the
river Anio, pitched his camp where Anio flows into
the Tiber. And by this time the men of Veii also
had come up with their army, and these were on the
right wing next to the river, and the men of Fidenæ
on the left, next to the mountains. The ordering of
King Tullus was that he and his men should do
battle with the men of Veii, and Mettus and the
Albans with the men of Fidenæ. Now Mettus, as he
was not minded to do right, so had no courage to do
wrong boldly; and because he dared not to go over
to the enemy, led his men away slowly toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
mountains. Being come thither, he set out his men
in battle array, being minded to join them whom he
should perceive to prevail. At first the Romans
marvelled that Mettus and his men should so depart
from them; and after a while they sent a messenger
to the king, saying, “The men of Alba have left
us.” Then the king knew in his heart that there
was treachery, and he vowed that he would build
temples to Paleness and Panic, if he should win
the victory that day. Nevertheless he showed no
sign of fear, but cried to the horsemen with a loud
voice, that the enemy might hear, saying, “Go thou
back to the battle, and bid thy comrades be of good
courage. Mettus does my bidding that he may
take the men of Fidenæ in the rear.” Also he bade
the cavalry raise their spears in the air, that so the
Romans might, for the most part, be hindered from
seeing that the men of Alba had deserted them; and
they that saw, believing what the king had said,
fought with the more courage. Then there fell a
great fear upon the enemy, for these also had heard
the saying, which, being in the Latin tongue, was
understood of the men of Fidenæ. They, therefore,
fearing lest Mettus and the army of Alba
should come down from the mountains and shut
them off from their town, began to give ground.
And when the king had broken their array, he
turned the more fiercely on the men of Veii. These
also fled before him, but were hindered from escape
by the river. And some, throwing away their arms,
ran blindly into the water, and some while they
lingered on the bank, and knew not whether they
should fight or fly, so perished. Never before had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
the Romans so fierce a fight with their enemies.
After this the king spoke in this fashion, “Men of
Rome, if ever before ye had occasion to give thanks
for victory won, first to the immortal gods, and
secondly to your own valor, such occasion ye found
in the battle of yesterday. For ye fought not only
with the enemy, but with that from which there is
peril greater by far, even treachery in allies. I would
not have you ignorant of the truth. It was not by
any ordering of mine that the men of Alba went
toward the mountains. I gave no such command;
yet did I feign that I had given it to this end, that
ye might not know that we were deserted, and so
might fight with the better courage, and that our
enemies, thinking that they should be assailed from
behind, might be stricken with fear and so fly before
us. Yet I say not that all the men of Alba are guilty
of this matter. They followed their captain, even as
ye, men of Rome, would have followed me whithersoever
I might have led you. Mettus only is guilty.
He contrived this departure, even as he brought
about this war, and brake the covenant that was
between Alba and Rome. And what he hath done
others may dare hereafter, if I do not so deal with
him that he shall be an ensample for all that come
after.” Then the captains of hundreds, having
arms in their hands, laid hold upon Mettus. After
this the king spake again: “May the gods bless to
the people of Rome, and to me, and to you also, men
of Alba, that which I purpose to do. For my purpose
is to carry away the people of Alba to Rome;
the commons of Alba will I make citizens of Rome,
and the nobles will I number among our senators.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
So shall there be one city and one commonwealth.”
When the men of Alba heard these words, all had
not the same mind about the matter, but all kept
silence, fearing to speak, because being without
arms they were compassed on every side with armed
men.</p>

<p>Then said the king, “Mettus, if indeed thou
couldst learn faith and the keeping of treaties, I
had suffered thee to live that thou mightest have
such teaching from me. But now, seeing that thy
disease is past healing, thou shalt teach other men to
hold in reverence the holy things which thou hast
despised. For even as thou wast divided in heart
between Rome and Fidenæ, so shall thy body be
divided.” Then, at the king’s bidding, they brought
two chariots, with four horses harnessed to each
of them; and binding the body of Mettus to the
chariots, they drave the horses divers ways so that
the man was torn asunder.</p>

<p>But because Alba was thus brought to destruction,
Rome increased greatly; for the number of
the citizens was increased twofold. The Cœlian
hill was added to the city, in which hill, that others
might the more readily dwell there, the king himself
commanded that they should build him a palace.
Also the chief houses of Alba, as the house of Julius
and of Servilius, were chosen into the Senate; and
that there might be a place of meeting for the Senate
being thus multiplied, the king built a temple
and called it Hostilia, after his own name. Also
ten squadrons of horsemen were chosen out of the
men of Alba.</p>

<p>Now the end of King Tullus was this. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
came a pestilence upon the land. And when for
this cause the people were wearied of war, nevertheless
the king, both because he delighted in war,
and because he believed that the young men should
have better health if they went abroad than if they
tarried at home, gave them no rest. But after a
while he also fell into a tedious sickness, which so
brake him both in body and mind that, whereas in
time past he thought it unworthy of a king to busy
himself with matters of religion, now he gave himself
up wholly to superstition, and filled the minds
of his people also with the like thoughts, so that
they regarded nothing but this, how they should
make atonement to the gods, and so be rid of their
present distress. As for the king himself, men
say that reading the sacred book of King Numa
he found therein certain sacrifices, very secret and
solemn, that should be done to Jupiter by such as
would bring him down from heaven, and that he
shut himself up to do these sacrifices; but because
he set not about them rightly or did than not in
due form, there appeared to him no similitude of
the immortal gods (for such he had hoped to see);
but Jupiter, having great wrath at such unlawful
dealings, struck him with lightning and consumed
both him and his house.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
